# Introduction: what's a function (in R)?

![:scale 90%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20210624/20210624_function_flow.png)

```r
# create your function
my_function <- function(var1) {
    # "do something" with var1 to generate an output
    return(output)
}

# use your function as many times as you want
input1 <- 5
my_value1 <- my_function(input1)
input2 <- 6
my_value2 <- my_function(input2)
```

# Introduction: When do we ABSOLUTELY need functions?

When do we **absolutely** need functions? If both these conditions are true:

- you have to `"do something"` longer than one line of code
- you need to `"do something"` at least for two different inputs

# Introduction: When do we SHOULD use functions?

- the "do something" is actually a workflow: split it in (small) functions
- the "do something" is very short (e.g. a one-line formula) but often used: putting it in a function will give it an understandable name and will avoid typos

- functions are the building blocks of your data analysis
- give your functions understandable and short enough names

## Coding club play tables

**Like** a card club, we will split us in different tables (aka _breakout rooms_) and we will help each other! We return all together after a fixed amount of time to discuss each challenge apart.

**Unlike** a card club, in our club there is no winner, neither within a table nor among tables!

### Share your code during the coding session!

<!-- Create a new hackmd file and replace this link (twice!) -->
Go to https://hackmd.io/HoRyIsrqR9-uAGoGGDKbVA?both and start by adding your name in section "Participants".

# Download data and code

Today no R code script. We put all dataframes in a unique `.Rda` file

You can download the material:

- automatically via `inborutils::setup_codingclub_session()`*

- manually** from GitHub folder [coding-club/data/20210624](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20210624/)

<br>
<small> __\* Note__: you can use the date in "YYYYMMDD" format to download the coding club material of a specific day, e.g. run `setup_codingclub_session("20201027")` to download the coding club material of October, 27 2020. If date is omitted, the date of today is used. For all options, check the [tutorial online](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_setup_codingclub_session/).</small>
