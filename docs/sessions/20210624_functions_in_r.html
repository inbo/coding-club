# Introduction: When do we ABSOLUTELY need functions?

If both these conditions are true:

- you have to `"do something"` longer than one line of code
- you need to `"do something"` at least for two different inputs

---
class: left, top

# Introduction: When SHOULD we use functions?

- the "do something" is actually a workflow: split it in (small) functions
- the "do something" is very short (e.g. a one-line formula) but often used: putting it in a function will give it an understandable name and will avoid typos

# Introduction: good names

Functions are the building blocks of your data analysis: give your functions understandable and short enough names. It's better for you, it's better for everybody.

# Introduction: output of R functions

Can a R function return multiple outputs?

NO. R functions return only **one output**: `return(my_output)`

But you can put your outputs (e.g. a data.frame and a plot) in a list. A named list will make the future-you and any other using the function very happy: documentation begins by coding with style :-)

```r
library(tidyverse)
my_summary_function <- function(df, x_colname, y_colname) {
  df_prev <- head(df)
  point_overview <- ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(!!sym(x_colname), !!sym(y_colname)))
  return(list(df_preview = df_prev, plot_overview = point_overview))
}

overview_mtcars_mpg_disp <- my_summary_function(df = mtcars,
                                                x_colname = "mpg",
                                                y_colname = "disp")
overview_mtcars_mpg_disp$df_preview
overview_mtcars_mpg_disp$plot_overview
```

## Coding club play tables

**Like** a card club, we will split us in different tables (aka _breakout rooms_) and we will help each other! We return all together after a fixed amount of time to discuss each challenge apart.

**Unlike** a card club, in our club there is no winner, neither within a table nor among tables!

# The data world of Mrs. Z

Today you play the role of a researcher, Mrs Z. She received in January 2011 observations of the asian ladybeetle (_Harmonia axyridis_) collected in the surroundings of Antwerp by a contractor. These observations are stored in [20210624_harmonia_axyridis_2010.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20210624/20210624_harmonia_axyridis_2010.txt). She wrote some code to read, analyze and visualize these obsevations. You can find the code in [20210624_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20210624/20210624_challenges.R). She uses a geopacakge shapefile, [20210624_eea_1x1km_grid_BE.gpkg](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20210624/20210624_eea_1x1km_grid_BE.gpkg), containing the official [Belgian 1x1km square grid](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eea-reference-grids-2), as provided by the [European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/), useful to group observations in a grid.

What it seemed to be a one -shot anlysis, becomes very soon something more: she receives a similar file from another contractor containing observations of the bow-winged grasshopper (_Chorthippus biguttulus_) collected in the same area: [20210624_chorthippus_biguttulus_2010.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20210624/20210624_chorthippus_biguttulus_2010.txt). Important: the columns containing the coordinates are called differently.

She also get to know that she will have to redo the same analysis the next years, at least on observations of the Asian ladybeetle:
- [20210624_harmonia_axyridis_2011.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20210624/20210624_harmonia_axyridis_2011.txt)
- [20210624_harmonia_axyridis_2012.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20210624/20210624_harmonia_axyridis_2012.txt)

I think you can find yourself in the role of Mrs Z in this Oscar awarded movie.

Before starting, a best practice reminder: write the functions in a separate file. You can call it `20210624_functions.R`. You can use your functions in the challenge file by first _sourcing_ this file, e.g. `source("./src/20210624/20210624_functions.R")`.

# Challenge 1

1. It's January 2011. After getting the observations of Harmonia axyridis, you
get now observations of Chorthippus biguttulus. Write a function called
`get_obs_2010()` which takes
as argument a species (e.g. "Harmonia axyridis") and returns the observations
of 2010 as a data.frame

2. It's January 2012. Mrs Z got observations of Harmonia axyridis collected in 2011. How does she read these data? Does she create a new function, `get_obs_2011()` or does she best change the function she wrote one year before by renaming it  `get_obs()` and adding `year` as extra argument?

# Challenge 2 part 1

1. Write a function called `clean_data()` to handle step 2 and return the cleaned data.frame without suspected or not enough precise observations. Input arguments:
    - `df` data.frame with observations
    -  `max_coord_uncertain`: maximum of `coordinateUncertaintyInMeters` (numeric), deafult value as in script
    - `issues_to_discard` (character vector), default value as in script
    - `occurrenceStatus_to_discard` (character vector), default value as in script
2. Write a function called `assign_eea_cell()` to handle step 3. Return  a `df` as input, with two extra columns: `geometry` and `eea_cell_code`, the last one containing the EEA cell code each observation belongs to. Input argument:
    - `df` data.frame with observations
    - `longitude_colname`: character, name of the column with longitude values*
    - `latitude_colname`: character, name of the column with latitude values*
<br>
<small> __\* Note__: `!!sym()` can help you to use the longitude/latitude colnames in the `mutate()` step</small>

# Challenge 2 part 2

3. Although short, step 4 should be put in a function apart, instead of being part of the previous function. Do you agree? Why? If you agree, put it in a function called  `get_n_obs_per_cell()`

4. Write a function for step 5. Would you read the shapefile with the EEA grid of Belgium in the function or outside the function? up to you to find a good name to the function :-)

# Challenge 3

1. We are almost there. Adapt the last part of the code to be able to personalize the interactive leaflet. Write a function called `visualize_obs_cells()`, which should allow the user to make leaflet maps for any `species` and any `year`. Allow the user also to specify his/her own color palette (`pal`) and the filling color opacity of the cells. You can use the values in the code as default values. Test the function providing other input values.

2. Now that we have all blocks, what do you think to automatize the entire workflow by creating a function called `make_report()`? Think about which arguments you need as input. Return a list containing:
    - the data.frame returned by step 4
    - the leaflet map
