## Recap: what did I learn during the last coding club?

The ggplot recipe: <strong>data - mapping - geometry</strong>

class: left, middle

## Recap: what did I learn during the last coding club?

1. Mapping can be defined in the geometry
2. The most important mapping argument? **aes**thetics!
3. Put all arguments which require variables (= columns) in `aes()`, all other arguments outside in the geometry

Example:

```r
# you want color represents the supplement (supp)
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = supp))

# you want all points are blue hollow triangles
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", shape = 2)
```

## Load libraries

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(viridis)
library(plotly)
```

If you get an error because a package is not yet installed, just install it first via `install.packages("put here the name of the package")`.


## Download data and code

You can download the material:

- automatically via `inborutils::setup_codingclub_session()`*

- manually, via [data](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20210930/) and [scripts](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20210930/)**!

<br>
<small> __\* Note__: you can use the date in "YYYYMMDD" format to download the coding club material of a specific day, e.g. run `setup_codingclub_session("20201027")` to download the coding club material of October, 27 2020. If date is omitted, the date of today is used. For all options, check the [tutorial online](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_setup_codingclub_session/).</small>

# Challenge 1. Palettes

1. A _palette_ is nothing more than a character vector of colors. Create your own 4-color palette with [color picker](http://tristen.ca/hcl-picker/). Here an [example](https://tristen.ca/hcl-picker/#/hlc/4/1/124B46/7DC979):
2. How to use it for `usercase1`?
3. How to use it for `usercase3`?
4. How to invert the color scale of `usercase3`?

---
class: left, middle

## Intermezzo. How to choose a color palette

A color palette should be:
1. printer-friendly (gray scale)
2. perceptually uniform
3. easy to read by those with colorblindness.

All of this can be found in the [viridis palette](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/07/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/) which avoids the red and to go from blue to yellow passing through green (_viridis_: green in Latin).

## Intermezzo. The _viridis_ color palette

`ggplot2` includes some functions to use the viridis palette directly.

Apply viridis discrete color scale (user case 1 and 2):

```
usercase1 +
  scale_color_viridis_d()
```

Apply viridis continuous color scale (user case 3 and 4):

```
usercase3 +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

Invert the color direction:

```
usercase3 +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1)
```

# Challenge 2. The [patchwork package](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)

1. Display `usercase1` and `usercase2` next to each other

2. Display `usercase2` below `usercase1`

3. Display `usercase1` and `usercase2`in first row and `usercase3` and `usercase4` in the second row creating a 2x2 plot grid

4. `usercase1` and `usercase2` share same legend. How to avoid duplicating it in 1 and 2?

5. What if you try to avoid duplicating the legend of `usercase3` and `usercase4`? Can you understand why? How to solve it? Hint: _scale_ first your plots, check ggplot cheatsheet!

## CHALLENGE 3A. Fine tune your plots

1. An heatmap as usercase3 should fill the entire plot space. No sense of having space above, below, left or right. How to solve it?

2. Remove the title and the legend of `usercase3`

3. Set legend of  `usercase3` below the heatmap. The title is set too low in comparison with the colorbar, isn't? How to align it with the colorbar? How to customize the legend background and border by using light grey as background color and blue as border color?

4. Starting from 3, how to set a space of 0.5cm between plotting area and legend box?

## CHALLENGE 3B. Make your plots interactive


1. Make usercase1 interactive. Hint: give a look to this [tutorial](https://www.musgraveanalytics.com/blog/2018/8/24/how-to-make-ggplot2-charts-interactive-with-plotly)

2. Specify the following order of information displayed while hovering with mouse:

3. Make usercase 3 interactive as well. But one decimal value is more than enough for `meanArea`. How to improve the displayed info?

4. Personalize the text shown while hovering as in the example below:
```
region: FL
biotope: Urban
area: 50.3%
```

## BONUS CHALLENGE - patchwork

1. Display `usercase3` on the left and a table with the displayed data (species, region, biotope, meanArea) on the right.

2. We have to submit the assembled plot in Challenge 2 - exercise 3 for publication in a Elsevier journal. Yes, we have no choice :-( How to apply the Elsevier _theme_? And how to add lowercase roman numerals to enumerate the subplots?
