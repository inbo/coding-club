## Introduction

We will explore the functionalities provided by two "made in INBO" packages and then we play with SQL and tidyverse.

1. [inbodb](https://inbo.github.io/inbodb/index.html)
2. [watina](https://inbo.github.io/watina/index.html)

---
class: left, top

## `inbodb` package

1. Connect to any INBO database
2. Run specific queries for two INBO databases: florabank and INBOVEG


[inbodb functions](https://inbo.github.io/inbodb/reference/index.html)

## `watina` package

1. Connect to watina database
2. Run specific queries for watina database
3. Provide some useful helper functions

[watina functions](https://inbo.github.io/watina/reference/index.html)

## Coding club play tables

**Like** a card club, we will split us in different tables (aka _breakout rooms_) and we will help each other! We return all together after a fixed amount of time to discuss each challenge apart.

**Unlike** a card club, in our club there is no winner, neither within a table nor among tables!

# Download data and code

- no data file today: we use databases, aren't we?
- Download R script automatically via `inborutils::setup_codingclub_session()`
- Download R script manually* from [src/20220125](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20220125). Place the R script in your folder `src/20220125/`

<small>* __Note__: check the getting started instructions on [how to download a single file](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/gettingstarted.html#each-session-setup)</small>

## Challenge 0

1. Log in to [INBO VPN](https://vpnvac.inbo.be/sslvpn/Portal/Main)
2. If not done, install the required packages `inbodb` and `watina` by following the instructions:
  - [inbodb installation instructions](https://inbo.github.io/inbodb/#installation)
  - [watina installation instructions](https://inbo.github.io/watina/index.html#installing-testing-and-using-the-watina-package)
3. Load the required packages:
```r
library(tidyverse)
library(inbodb)
library(watina)
```
4. Open connections to databases
```r
watina <- connect_watina()
inboveg <- connect_inbo_dbase("D0010_00_Cydonia")
florabank <- connect_inbo_dbase("D0021_00_userFlora")
```
5. Did you get this error: `"The 'ODBC Driver for SQL Server' is missing. Please install it or contact your system administrator."`? We will contact ICT helpdesk this afternoon, but now restart R session (Ctrl + Shft + F10) and run this:
```r
remotes::install_github("inbo/inbodb@sos")
```

# Challenge 1

1. Find the R connection pane of RStudio and open a view of table `tblTaxon` of `florabank` (`D0021_00_userFlora`), table `ivRecording` of INBOVEG (`D0010_00_Cydonia`) and table `DimChemVar` of watina (`W0002_00_Watina`). Tips: check [RStudio connection pane documentation](https://db.rstudio.com/rstudio/connections/#connections-pane); tables are under (default) `dbo` _schema_

2. Still using the RStudio connection pane, find the type of the columns of (one of the) tables in 1, e.g. *char*acter, *int*eger

3. What type does `bit` stand for? Tip: check e.g. the values contained in column `CURRENT_IND` of table `DimChemVar` opened in 1

# Intermezzo 1: R is lazy... so are we

Let us get the locations from watina database using watina function `get_locs(watina)`. Why do you get an error if you try to save them in a text format (e.g. csv)?

```r
locations <- get_locs(watina)
write_csv(x = locations, file = "./data/locations.csv")

> Error in write_delim(x, file, delim = ",", na = na, append = append, col_names = col_names,  :
  is.data.frame(x) is not TRUE
```

Is locations not a data.frame???

```r
class(locations)
[1] "tbl_Microsoft SQL Server" "tbl_dbi"
[3] "tbl_sql"                  "tbl_lazy"
[5] "tbl"
```

All you have is a table (`tbl`), but most of all, it's a _lazy table_... Welcome to the lazy woRld!

# Intermezzo 1: R is lazy... so are we

![:scale 100%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20220125/20220125_lazy_query.png)

`locations` is an SQL query, no data are really loaded on your laptop.
It is like a reference to the result of the query but the full result of the query is not brought into memory.

If you are thinking: _"are you kidding me?"_ Well, try this:


```r
locations %>% show_query()
```

IMPORTANT: to avoid bad surprises (crashes, out of memory issues), first run your queries lazily.

# Intermezzo 1: R is lazy... so are we

<best-practices-for-working-with-databases-march-2018-edgar-ruiz>![:scale 10%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20220125/20220125_mister_lazy.jpg)</center>

R is not only lazy with databases, R is ALWAYS lazy

```r
number <- 5
multiply_by_2 <- function(a, b) {
  a * 2 # b is not used
}
multiply_by_2(number) # no value given to argument b
```

`b` is a function argument, but never evaluated, so no error. This is what we mean by being **lazy**: doing **the strict minimum** of evaluation*. For this reason lazy evaluation is sometimes referred as _call-by-need_.

<small>
*More about lazy evaluation? Give a look at [this tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/07/about-lazy-evaluation/)... or spend a coffeebreak with Thierry ;-)

# Challenge 2

1. Using watina package and (trying to stay) in lazy mode:

    a. How many area codes exist in watina database? Tip: dplyr functions can help staying in lazy mode

    b. select locations from watina database with `area_codes` `"MAY"` or `"LIN"` and depth range between 2 and 3 meters. How to return only the latest observation well per location?

2. Using inbodb and still being lazy, get observations of invasive species _Impatiens glandulifera_ and _Hydrocotyle ranunculoides_ from `florabank` database

3. Using inbodb and still being lazy, search recordings collected during survey `"ABS-LIM2011"` in `inboveg` database

4. How to _collect_ the lazy data queried in 1, 2 and 3?

# Intermezzo 2: do I really need to learn SQL?

Not everything is already wrapped in a function, of course. How to write your own SQL query?

If you know SQL syntax, excellent!

```r
gebogen_kransblad_query <- "SELECT NaamWetenschappelijk
                            FROM tblTaxon
                            WHERE NaamNederlands = 'Gebogen kransblad'"
tbl(src = florabank,
    sql(gebogen_kransblad_query))
```

But you do not have to be an SQL programmer, thanks to tidyverse!

```r
tbl(src = florabank, "tblTaxon") %>%
  filter(NaamNederlands == "Gebogen kransblad") %>%
  select(NaamWetenschappelijk)
```

class: left, top

# Challenge 3

Feel free to use tidyverse syntax or SQL syntax or experiment both!

1. Using `florabank` and its table `tblTaxon`:

  a. get the first 10 rows

  b. get the scientific name (`NaamWetenschappelijk`) of Dutch name (`NaamNederlands`) _Slank snavelmos_

  c. get the scientific names and Dutch names of taxa with Dutch name starting with _Slank_. [Tip for SQL query](https://www.w3schools.com/SQL/sql_like.asp); [tip for tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr/issues/295)

2. Using `INBOVEG` database and its table `ivRecording`, retrieve the 10 locations (`LocationCode`) with the highest number of recordings with
`Latitude` between 50.9 and 51.1 and `Longitude` between 3.5 and 3.9. Show the locations and the number of recordings and order them by decreasing order (location with highest number of recordings first)

3. How to get the column names of table `ivRecording` from `INBOVEG`?

# Bonus challenge 1

Writing queries can be hard and we have specialists in house who are great at it... Let's make sure we can reuse our own and their hard work!

Based on solution of challenge 3.2, create a function called `inboveg_locs_most_recs()`:

- the function has four input arguments:
  - a connection to database ( `con`)
  - number of locations to return (`n_locations`),
  - vector with min/max values of `Latitude` (lat)
  - vector with min/max values of `Longitude` (lng)
- the function returns a dataframe with two columns: `locationCode` and `n` (number of recordings) arranged by decreasing values of  `n`
- test your function by using it, e.g.

```r
inboveg_locs_most_recs(inboveg, n_locations = 8, lat = c(50.1, 50.3), lng = c(4.2, 4.9))
```
- write it in SQL* or in tidyverse syntax

<small>* Package [glue](https://glue.tidyverse.org/) can help you. [This part](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_database_access/#create-and-use-query-templates) of the tutorial can also help...</small>

# Bonus challenge 2

Packages inbodb and watina and their functions can be improved, of course!
Add a new functionality to one of the `get_` functions of `inbodb` or `watina`, e.g. add an argument, `sf_poly` (a `sf` polygon) to [`get_inboveg_header()`](https://inbo.github.io/inbodb/reference/get_inboveg_header.html) to retrieve metadata for vegetation recordings located in the polygon `sf_poly`.

# HELP FUTURE-YOU

Do you have queries you run very often? Do you have queries where you have to change some arguments manually (e.g. taxon name, location code)?

Add an issue to the `inbodb` or the `watina` package and help future-you and your colleagues.

`inbodb` and `watina` are not monoliths, static things. **WE** (users) can improve it.
