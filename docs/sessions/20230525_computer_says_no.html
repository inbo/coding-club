# It's all about colors!

Last month we very briefly spoke about [cols4all](https://github.com/mtennekes/cols4all), an interesting package with an User Interface to choose your best color palette. Well, there is another very interesting color dedicated R package maybe you would like to give a try: [colorspace](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/index.html).

_Finding your bug is a process of confirming the many things that you believe are true — until you find one which is not true. _ (Norm Matloff)

Debugging first rule

Read carefully the error message and search on the web: Google! Nowaday, you would maybe give a try to Artificial Intelligence tools as ChatGPT...

Example 1:

```
Error in `mutate()`:
ℹ In argument: `delta_t = as.numeric(as.duration(time_first_dist_to_use -
  departure))`.
Caused by error in `as.duration()`:
! could not find function "as.duration"
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.
```

# Debugging first rule

Example 3: error is far from being informative for "normal" people

```
my_gamma_est <- function(data) {
  # fit a gamma distribution to a vector of numbers
  m < mean(data)
  v <- var(data)
  s <- v/m
  a <- m/s
  return(list(a=a,s=s))
}
```

```
my_gamma_est(cats$Hwt)
Error in my_gamma_est(cats$Hwt) :
  'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double'
```

As you can see in the screenshot, it seems ChatGPT not help us so much:

# Intermezzo: defensive programming - what is it?

Debugging starts already while writing code! Defensive programming is the best way to solve bunch of (future) bugs: the future-you will praise you.

1. Add pre-conditions to your functions to avoid unexpected and unpredictable errors in later stages (**fail fast principle**: stop the current operation as soon as any unexpected error occurs)
```r
# PSEUDOCODE !!
if (date < today) stop("Date is too early");
if (class input != numeric vector) stop("Invalid type of input: only numeric vectors allowed.")
```

2. Assert statements to validate output at intermediate steps, e.g. output of 3rd party libraries that you use in your project.

---
class: left, top

# Intermezzo: defensive programming - example

Apply defensive programming to the `custom_min()` function here below to avoid unexpected  behaviors:

```
# customized `min()` function for NUMERIC(!) vectors to avoid warning while calculating min() of empty
# vectors
custom_min <- function(x) {
  if (length(x)>0) min(x) else NA
}
> custom_min(c("e", "r", "a")) # passing chars should return an error
[1] "a"
```

---
class: left, top

# Intermezzo: defensive programming - example

The package [assertthat](https://rdocumentation.org/packages/assertthat/versions/0.2.1) is very useful while applying defensive programming in your coding life. What we do is adding assertion(s) to our function.

```
library(assertthat)
# customized `min()` function for NUMERIC(!) vectors to avoid warning while calculating min() of empty
# vectors
custom_min <- function(x) {
  # check x argument (assertion)
  assertthat::assert_that(
    is.numeric(x),
    msg = "Invalid type of input: only numeric vectors allowed."
  )
  # function core follows
  if (length(x)>0) min(x) else NA
}

# only numeric input are allowed, error arises otherwise
custom_min(c("a", "b"))
Error: Invalid type of input: only numeric vectors allowed.
```

# Challenge 3 - Debug & defensive programming

Let's move to something more familiar: eels tagging data.

The function `get_migrations()` works nicely in example 1, but it fails in other examples. By giving a look to the function, the arguments passed to, the error messages, add a series of checks (assertions) to fail fast and "nicely".

# Bonus challenge

Apply defensive programming to avoid unexpected behavior or cryptic error messages ("fail fast" principle) to functions described in challenge 1 and 2.

Function crashes with:

1.  "very large" numbers

2. decimal numbers

# Miscellaneous tips: smaller the better

1. Build up code in small pieces, testing along the way, step by step
1. Make big changes in small steps
1. Smaller functions are better: easier to debug, easier to understand

---
class: left, top

# Miscellaneous tips: do not code _hard_

1. Do not __hard__code numbers: use variables instead (number of iterations, parameter values in simulations, ...). Easier to read and reduce bugs when you use the same number multiple times
1. Avoid using **global variables** in your function
```r
txt <- "INBO"
my_function <- function() {
  paste(txt, "is fantastic!")
}
> my_function()
[1] "INBO is fantastic!"
```
1. Avoid reusing **global variables** names in your function: vey confusing and prone to bugs.
```r
txt <- "INBO"
my_function <- function() {
  txt = "fantastic"
  paste("coding together is", txt)
}
> my_function()
[1] "coding together is fantastic"
> txt
[1] "INBO"
```

# Miscellaneous tips: optimize your code

We are typically lazy, aren't we?

"Does my code run?"

"Yes!"

"But it takes hours and GB of memory!"

"I don't mind, it's fine..."

However, this kind of code can easily crash when running on slighly bigger datasets.

Let's try the [profiler](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/218221837-Profiling-with-RStudio#using-the-profiler) built in RStudio!
