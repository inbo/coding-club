# It's all about colors!

Last month we very briefly spoke about [cols4all](https://github.com/mtennekes/cols4all), an interesting package with a User Interface to choose your best color palette. Well, there is another very interesting color dedicated R package maybe you would like to give a try: [colorspace](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/index.html).

Read carefully the error message and search on the web: Google! Nowaday, you would maybe give a try to Artificial Intelligence tools as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).

And let's train our eyes!

Example 1

```
Error in `mutate()`:
ℹ In argument: `delta_t = as.numeric(as.duration(time_first_dist_to_use -
  departure))`.
Caused by error in `as.duration()`:
! could not find function "as.duration"
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.

# A memory aid

## Traceback your code

`traceback` your code to find where it stops to work.

In RStudio: in **Debug pane** -> **On Error** -> **Error Inspector** and then click on **Show Traceback** in the error message <p>
![:scale 100%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20230525/20230525_livecoding_show_traceback.png)</p>
In basic R:
```r
options(error = "traceback") # trace the error back, better than options(error = "message")
```

## Debug your code: activate debugging mode


### 1st alternative

Source the file with the functions only and set breakpoints (red circles) where you think something wrong happens

### 3rd alternative

Activate debugging mode on a specific function by using `debug(function_name)` or `debugonce(function_name)`.

```r
debug(calc_var) # or debugonce(calc_var)
```

Once this function is debugged, run `undebug(function_name)`.

## Debug your code: work in debugging mode

Once you are in debugging mode, use **Next** (n) to move to next line, **Continue** (c) to go to next breakpoint (red circles)

# 123 magic

Write down a positive integer on a piece of paper:

```
886328712442992
```

Count up the number of even and odd digits, and the total number of digits:

```
10 5 15
```

String the digits of those three numbers together to make a new number:

```
10515
```

Perform the same operation on the obtained number:

```
1 4 5 ⟶ 145
```

And keep iterating:

```
1 2 3 ⟶ 123
```

You'll always arrive at the number 123!

# Intermezzo: defensive programming

Debugging starts already while writing code! Defensive programming is the best way to solve bunch of (future) bugs: the future-you will praise you.

1. Add pre-conditions to your functions to avoid unexpected and unpredictable errors in later stages (**fail fast principle**: stop the current operation as soon as any unexpected error occurs)
```r
# PSEUDOCODE !!
if (date < today) stop("Date is too early");
if (class input != numeric vector) stop("Invalid type of input: only numeric vectors allowed.")
```

2. Assert statements to validate output at intermediate steps, e.g. output of 3rd party libraries that you use in your project.

---
class: left, top

# Intermezzo: defensive programming - example

Apply defensive programming to the `custom_min()` function here below to avoid unexpected  behaviors:

```
# customized `min()` function for NUMERIC(!) vectors
# to avoid warning while calculating min() of empty vectors
custom_min <- function(x) {
  if (length(x)>0) min(x) else NA
}
> custom_min(c("e", "r", "a")) # passing chars should return an error
[1] "a"
```

---
class: left, top

# Intermezzo: defensive programming - example

The package [assertthat](https://rdocumentation.org/packages/assertthat/versions/0.2.1) is very useful while applying defensive programming in your coding life. What we do is adding assertion(s) to our function.

```
library(assertthat)
# customized `min()` function for NUMERIC(!) vectors
# to avoid warning while calculating min() of empty vectors
custom_min <- function(x) {
  # check x argument (assertion)
  assertthat::assert_that(
    is.numeric(x),
    msg = "Invalid type of input: only numeric vectors allowed."
  )
  # function core follows
  if (length(x)>0) min(x) else NA
}

# only numeric input are allowed, error arises otherwise
custom_min(c("a", "b"))
Error: Invalid type of input: only numeric vectors allowed.
```

# Challenge 3 - Debug & defensive programming

Let's move to something more familiar: eels tagging data.

The function `get_migrations()` works nicely in example 1, but it fails in other examples. By giving a look to the function, the values passed to the arguments and the error messages, try to understand what is going wrong and add a series of checks (assertions) to fail "fast" and "nicely".

# Bonus challenge

Apply defensive programming to avoid unexpected behavior or cryptic error messages to functions described in challenge 1 and 2.

Function crashes with:

1.  "very large" numbers

2. decimal numbers

# Miscellaneous tips: smaller the better

1. Build up code in small pieces, testing along the way, step by step
1. Make big changes in small steps
1. Smaller functions are better: easier to debug, easier to understand

---
class: left, top

# Miscellaneous tips: do not code so _hard_

1. Do not __hard__code numbers: use variables instead (number of iterations, parameter values in simulations, ...). Easier to read and reduce bugs when you use the same number multiple times
1. Avoid using **global variables** in your function
```r
txt <- "INBO"
my_function <- function() {
  paste(txt, "is fantastic!")
}
> my_function()
[1] "INBO is fantastic!"
```
1. Avoid reusing **global variables** names in your function: very confusing and prone to bugs.
```r
txt <- "INBO"
my_function <- function() {
  txt <- "fantastic"
  paste("coding together is", txt)
}
> my_function()
[1] "coding together is fantastic"
> txt
[1] "INBO"
```

# Miscellaneous tips: optimize your code

We are typically lazy, aren't we?

A: "Does my code run?"

B: "Yes!"

A: "But it takes hours and GB of memory!"

B: "I don't mind, it runs after all ..."

However, this kind of code could easily crash when running on bigger datasets.

Let's try the [profiler](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/218221837-Profiling-with-RStudio#using-the-profiler) built in RStudio!

# The package of the month. Hans' choice

Hans came out again with a package I have never heard: [waldo](https://waldo.r-lib.org/). It's a package from the tidyverse collection, which shows you the differences between two objects in a very readable way.

Try this:

```
library(waldo) # install first if needed
waldo::compare(c("a", "b", "c"), c("a", "b"))
```

Another important case is strings vs factors:
