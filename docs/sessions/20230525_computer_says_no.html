# It's all about colors!

Last month we very briefly spoke about [cols4all](https://github.com/mtennekes/cols4all), an interesting package with an User Interface to choose your best color palette. Well, there is another very interesting color dedicated R package maybe you would like to give a try: [colorspace](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/index.html).
