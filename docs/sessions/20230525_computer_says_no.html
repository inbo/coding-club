<!-- Adjust the presentation to the session. Focus on the challenges,
    this is not a coding tutorial.

    Note, to include figures, store the image in the `/docs/assets/images/yyyymmdd/`
    folder and use the jekyll base.url reference as done in this template
    or see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#links.
    using the scale attribute ![:scale 30%](...), you can adjust the image size.

# It's all about colors!

Last month we very briefly spoke about [cols4all](https://github.com/mtennekes/cols4all), an interesting package with an User Interface to choose your best color palette. Well, there is another very interesting color dedicated R package maybe you would like to give a try: [colorspace](https://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/index.html).
