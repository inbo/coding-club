<!-- Adjust the presentation to the session. Focus on the challenges,
    this is not a coding tutorial.

    Note, to include figures, store the image in the `/docs/assets/images/yyyymmdd/`
    folder and use the jekyll base.url reference as done in this template
    or see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#links.
    using the scale attribute ![:scale 30%](...), you can adjust the image size.
