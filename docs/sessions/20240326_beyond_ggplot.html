# RECAP: ggplot recipe: data - mapping - geometry

![:scale 80%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20240326/20240326_ggplot_recipe.png)

---
class: left, top

## Recap: mapping

Mapping can be defined in either `ggplot()` or the geometry `geom_*()`.

```r
# mapping in ggplot()
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point()
# mapping in geometry geom_point()
ggplot(ToothGrowth) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len))
```

What to do with multiple plots (geometries)?

```r
# set all args of aes() in each geom_*()
ggplot(ToothGrowth) +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len, group = dose)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len))
# put common args of aes() in ggplot()
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(group = dose)) +
  geom_point()
```

---
class: left, top

## Recap: mapping - aesthetics

The most important mapping argument? **aes()**thetics! Put all arguments which require variables (= columns) in `aes()`, leave all other arguments out.

```r
# you want color represents the supplement (supp)
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = supp))

# you want all points are blue hollow triangles
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", shape = 2)
```

# Challenge 1. Interactivity and scales

1. Make `plot1` interactive with plotly. Hint: check the plotly [Getting Started](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/getting-started/).

2. Months are integers. How to improve the x breaks in plot2 to avoid decimal values?
 Hint: use `pretty_breaks()` from scales package within the right ggplot `scale_*` function.

3. Starting from plot3, use 'yy notation for x-labels (e.g. '12 instead of
 2012). For y-labels, use "K" suffix for thousands (e.g. 2K for 2000). Hint:
 example code in ["Break and
 labels"](https://scales.r-lib.org/#breaks-and-labels) section of scales
 homepage.

# Intermezzo. How to choose a color palette: the viridis palette

Today we won't speak about colors. Still, take in mind this criteria when choosing a color palette:

1. printer-friendly (gray scale)
2. perceptually uniform
3. easy to read by those with colorblindness.

All of this can be found in the [viridis palette](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/07/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/) which avoids the red and goes from blue to yellow, passing through green (_viridis_: green in Latin).

# Intermezzo. The INBO official colors

Do you know that INBO has its own (color) theme? It's called [INBOtheme](https://inbo.github.io/INBOtheme/) and it's a package. Install it, load it and all figures will have authomatically an INBO touch. Read the nice [tutorials](https://inbo.github.io/INBOtheme/articles/index.html) for more.

```r
library(INBOtheme)

ggplot(data = rodentia, mapping = aes(x = year, fill = institutionCode)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(y = "observations")
```

# Challenge 2. Compositions

1. Try to make a nice composition of the 4 plots. You can use the improved
 versions of plot2 and plot3 created in challenge 1 of course. Tip: check the
 very well written [patchwork documentation](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/patchwork.html).

2. Using [ggforce](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/index.html), add a "facet zoom"  to `plot1` focussing on the last 5 years.

# Challenge 3. Animations

Let's animate plot4 with [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html).
Check also the [Getting Started](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html) page.
In particular, pay attention to the [Object Permanence](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html#object-permanence) concept. Also add a title that dynamically shows the species and time as it passes. Test some
`enter_*` and `exit_*` functions to animate the appearance and disappearance
of data. Save the animations. See the two exercises in the next slide.

# Challenge 3. Animations

1. Create an animation showing the observations species by species. See example below.

2. Create an animation showing the observations year by year. Hint: improve the aesthetics of `geom_point` of plot4. By default the animation has 100
frames and 10 frame per seconds (fps), i.e. a duration of 10s. How can you change these values?

# Bonus challenge. Add image to plot

The R package [magick](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/index.html) is the R
interface for ImageMagick, the most comprehensive open-source image processing
library available.
Using magick, add the INBO coding club logo to one of our plots.
