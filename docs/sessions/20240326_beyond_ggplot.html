# Data and scripts description

Today we will work with national/regional checklist data about Invasive Alien Species (IAS) and species distribution of butterflies among several biotopes.

- `20240326_ias_first_observed_BE.txt`: dataset about year of first observation of IAS in Belgium from 1950
- `20240326_ias_first_observed_regions.txt`: dataset about year of first observation of IAS in Belgian regions from 1950
- `20240326_ias_pathways_count.txt`: dataset about pathway of introduction of IAS in Belgium from 1950
- `20240326_area_biotopes.txt`: dataset about biotopes and distribution of two butterflies

- `20240326_challenges.R`: R script with code to start with

# RECAP: ggplot recipe: data - mapping - geometry

![:scale 80%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20240326/20240326_ggplot_recipe.png)

---
class: left, top

## Recap: mapping

Mapping can be defined in either `ggplot()` or the geometry `geom_*()`.

```r
# mapping in ggplot()
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point()
# mapping in geometry geom_point()
ggplot(ToothGrowth) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len))
```

What to do with multiple plots (geometries)?

```r
# set all args of aes() in each geom_*()
ggplot(ToothGrowth) +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len, group = dose)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len))
# put common args of aes() in ggplot()
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(group = dose)) +
  geom_point()
```

---
class: left, top

## Recap: mapping - aesthetics

The most important mapping argument? **aes()**thetics! Put all arguments which require variables (= columns) in `aes()`, leave all other arguments out.

```r
# you want color represents the supplement (supp)
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = supp))

# you want all points are blue hollow triangles
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", shape = 2)
```

# Challenge 1. Interactivity and scales

1. Make `plot1` interactive with plotly. Hint: check the plotly [Getting Started](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/getting-started/).

2. Months are integers. How to improve the x breaks to avoid decimal values?
 Hint: use `pretty_breaks()` from scales package within a ggplot `scale_*` function.

3. Starting from plot3, use 'yy notation for x-labels (e.g. '12 instead of
 2012). For y-labels, use "K" suffix for thousands (e.g. 2K for 2000). Hint:
 example code in ["Break and
 labels"](https://scales.r-lib.org/#breaks-and-labels) section of scales
 homepage.

# Intermezzo. How to choose a color palette: the viridis palette

Today we won't speak about colors. Still, take in mind this criteria when choosing a color palette:

1. printer-friendly (gray scale)
2. perceptually uniform
3. easy to read by those with colorblindness.

All of this can be found in the [viridis palette](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/07/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/) which avoids the red and goes from blue to yellow, passing through green (_viridis_: green in Latin).

More about colors in the Bonus Challenge and Resources slides.

# Intermezzo. The INBO official colors

Do you know that INBO has its own (color) theme? It's called [INBOtheme](https://inbo.github.io/INBOtheme/) and it's a package. Install it, load it and all figures will have authomatically an INBO touch. Read the nice [tutorials](https://inbo.github.io/INBOtheme/articles/index.html) for more.

```r
library(INBOtheme)

ggplot(data = ias_be, mapping = aes(x = first_observed)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle(label = "Temporal distribution of alien species introductions")
```

# Challenge 2. Compositions

1. Try to make a nice composition of the 4 plots. You can use the improved
 versions of plot2 and plot3 created in challenge 1 of course. Tip: check the
 very well written [patchwork documentation](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/articles/patchwork.html).

2. Using ggforce, add a "facet zoom"  to `plot1` focussing on the last 5 years.

# Challenge 3. Animations

Let's animate plot4 with [gganimate.](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html).
Check also the [Getting Started](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html) page.
In particular, add a title as to what each time point relates to. Test some
`enter_*` and `exit_*` functions to animate the appearance and disappearance
of data. Save the animations.

1. Create an animation showing the observations species by species.

2. Create an animation showing the observations year by year. By default the animation has 100
frames and 10 frame per seconds (fps), i.e. a duration of 10s. How to change these values?

# Bonus challenge. Add image to plot

The R package [magick](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/index.html) is the R
interface for ImageMagick, the most comprehensive open-source image processing
library available.
Using magick, add the INBO coding club logo to one of our plots.
