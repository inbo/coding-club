# Why lubridate?

A lot of reasons. But the main one is that it is very flexible while reading heterogenous strings representing date(times). I hope this example is enough:

```
horrible_mix_datetimes <- c(
  "2022-01-03a02;01;01",
  "20220103x02:01:01",
  "2022-01-03a02.01.01",
  "20220103T02:01:01",
  "2022010302:01:01"
)
lubridate::ymd_hms(horrible_mix_datetimes)
[1] "2022-01-03 02:01:01 UTC" "2022-01-03 02:01:01 UTC" "2022-01-03 02:01:01 UTC"
[4] "2022-01-03 02:01:01 UTC" "2022-01-03 02:01:01 UTC"
```

# Challenge 1

1. After reading the dataset `persian_hogweed_2022_scandinavia.csv` (code given), add a new column `date` to the data.frame of the type "Date" (see screenshot).
2. Add a column called `weekday` with the day of the week, e.g. "Monday".  Do you get week names in other language, e.g. Dutch? You probably need to specify the language `"English"` somewhere in the function :-) Tip: use [day.html](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/day.html) or the lubridate cheat sheet.
3. Use a *stamp* to create dates like this `"Occurrence recorded on Monday, Jan 23, 2023"`. Put them in a new column called `date_stamp`.
4. Add a column called `label` combining the values in columns `species`, `countryCode` and `date` in this way: "Occurrence of Heracleum persicum found in SE on Fri, 25-9-22.".

## Intermezzo. UTC, time zones & Daylight Saving Time

Some definitions:

- UTC (Coordinated Universal Time): not a time zone, but THE ** time standard**. See https://24timezones.com/time-zone/utc

- GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) : one of the well-known names of UTC+0 ** time zone**). GMT does observe Daylight Saving Time (unlike UTC which is not a time zone!), more on https://24timezones.com/gmt-vs-utc

- World time zone map: https://24timezones.com/timezone-map

- DST (Daylight Saving Time): â€œspring forward, fall back". 2019-03-26: [European Parliament voted in favor of a ban of DST by end 2021](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-parliament-votes-to-end-daylight-savings/a-48064185). However, finding a compromise with each EU member state was not as smooth as expected. Reasons? Pandemic, Brexit, bureaucracy and a substantial lack of  support from the state governements. Read [more](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/will-daylight-saving-time-ever-end) if interested.

## Intermezzo. UTC, time zones & Daylight Saving Time

- How to define time zones? Typically `"Continent/City"` works well:

```r
as_datetime("2020-08-01 09:00:00", tz = "Asia/Tehran")
[1] "2020-08-01 09:00:00 +0430"
as_datetime("2020-08-01 09:00:00", tz = "Europe/Brussels")
[1] "2020-08-01 09:00:00 CEST"
```

or a time zone abbreviation:

```r
as_datetime("2020-08-01 09:00:00", tz = "CET")
[1] "2020-08-01 09:00:00 CEST"
```

Note the authomatic conversion to CEST (Central Europe *Summer* Time). However, if you use CEST it will not work, and you get the GMT version:

```r
as_datetime("2020-08-01 09:00:00", tz = "CEST")
[1] "2020-08-01 07:00:00 GMT"
Warning message:
In as.POSIXlt.POSIXct(x, tz) : unknown timezone 'CEST'
```

CEST is ** NOT **  a time zone!

# Challenge 2

First, read 20230126_deployments.txt (code provided!). Notice how the datetimes are authomatically read as standard UTC times if expressed in the ISO standard , i.e. yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss!

1. Add a column called local_start and local_end with clock time showing the timezone. The deployments are all located in Belgium. Notice that the datetimes in `start` and `end` are UTC times. Tip: read the [time-zones](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/lubridate-package.html#time-zones) section from the "Get started".
2. Oh no, the data manager said us that `start` and `end` are not UTC times but local times: a bug in the system  caused the loss of the time zone while writing the datetime. How to set `local_time` and `local_end` properly in this case? Tip: the same as before. Correct UTC `start` and `end` columns as well.
3. Based on `start` and `end`, calculate the duration of each deployment and store it in column `duration`
4. Get hour and day information of the start of the deployments. You can store them as additional columns called `hour_start`, `day_start`

How to detect/remove/extract:

- anything but letters `a `, `b` and `e`?
- all  full stops (`.`)?
- any extra full stop (`.`)?

# Challenge 3

1. Select the occurrences of persian hogweed coming from the [Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility](https://laji.fi/en) (FinBIF), i.e. the occurrences with occurrenceID starting with `http://tun.fi/`. Store them in a new data.frame called `finbif_occs`.
2. Retrieve the authorship from column `scientificName`, i.e. the string after the value in column `species`. Store it in a new column called `authorship`.
3. Get the "internal" ID for each occurrence of `persian_hogweed` dataframe. Such ID is the number after the very last colon (`:`), dot (`.`) or slash (`/`), e.g. `105853683` for `urn:lsid:artportalen.se:sighting:105853683` or `36631219` for `http://tun.fi/MKC.36631219` or `63a587a8d5de65595547a609#Unit1` for `http://tun.fi/KE.176/63a587a8d5de65595547a609#Unit1`. Tip: one of [these functions](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/reference/str_split.html) and a simple regex can help you a lot!

class: left, top

# Bonus challenge: strings

Regex is very powerful but can become quite complex. Fortunately, we have the cheat sheet and regex101 website. But also we have the entire internet, full of regex questions/answers :-)

1. The occurrences in `finbif_occs` are coming from different projects. They can be identified by the letters following the prefix `"http://tun.fi/"` and preceding a dot, e.g.  `MKC` for `http://tun.fi/MKC.36631219`,  `JX` for `http://tun.fi/JX.1443935#3`. Extract the project acronyms from the `occurrenceID` of `finbif_occs` and store them in column `project`. Tip: check the cheat sheet and use [regex101](https://regex101.com) website.

2. Metal rings, typically applied to animals such as birds, should be expressed
as a letter followed by a sequence of 10 digits. If less than 10 digits are
present on the ring, dots should be added between the letter and the digits.
Example: `E123456` should become `E.....123456`. Tip: cheat sheet helps a lot!

```
metal_rings <- c("A1234567890", "B123456789", "C12345678", "D1234567")
```

# Bonus challenge: dates

The provided code in 20230126_challenges.R analyzes produces a plot where data are grouped by week. How to leave the plot as it is but putting breaks and labels at month level? You should get something like this plot below. Tip: use ggplot function `scale_x_continuous()` and define the right values for `breaks` and `labels` arguments.

# The future of UTC: to leap or not to leap?

UTC is based on time as measured by atomic clocks so it is independent of Earth's rotation.
The [leap second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), to accommodate the imprecise observed solar time (irregularities and slowdown in the Earth's rotation).

![:scale 75%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20230126/20230126_leapsecond2016.png)

So, what to do with these annoying leap seconds? Should the standard UTC be getting rid of them or not?
