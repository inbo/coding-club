## Introduction: open software

While preparing the coding club, I got this revealing quote from R:

## raster, terra, stars, sf, sp, ... HELP!

R is rapidly evolving to fill the gap with Python and C++. Downside: new packages are being developed, old ones are modified or superseded.

### Spatial vector data

Topic of the coding club of October

- **sf** : newest and recommended package
- **sp** : its predecessor

### Spatial raster data

- [**terra**](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/terra-package.html) : newest and recommended package
- [**raster**](https://rspatial.org/raster/pkg/index.html) : its predecessor (no support for sf), match with sp
- [**stars**](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) : for **s**patio**t**emporal **ar**ray**s**

For more info, read this great [article](https://geocompr.github.io/post/2021/spatial-classes-conversion/) about conversions among different spatial classes in R.

## A raster is ...


- a `SpatRaster` object in `terra`
- a  `RasterLayer` object in  `raster`
- a `stars` object in `stars`

## Coding club play tables

**Like** a card club, we will split us in different tables (aka _breakout rooms_) and we will help each other! We return all together after a fixed amount of time to discuss each challenge apart.

**Unlike** a card club, in our club there is no winner, neither within a table nor among tables!

# Challenge 1

1. Read `20211125_lu_nara_2016_100m.tif` as a SpatRaster (terra) and call it `lu_nara_2016`. Tip: [basics](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/terra-package.html#i-creating-combining-and-sub-setting-spatraster-objects) from terra documentation
2. Which layers (**names**) does it contain? What is the **crs**? The **ext**ent? The **res**olution? What are the **minmax** values of the raster?
3. **plot** the raster. Note: ignore the errors "`Error in x$.self$finalize() : attempt to apply non-function`"
4. Read `20211125_lu_nara_legend.txt` (code is provided!) so that you can set the
color table associated with `lu_nara_2016`
5. Calculate the most and least occurring land use category in each of the Natura2000 protected areas. Tip: use `exactextractr::exact_extract()` with the right [summary operations](https://isciences.gitlab.io/exactextractr/#summary-operations)

# Challenge 2

1. Read the color-infrared image `20211125_cir_ename.tif` as `cir`
2. How many layers does it contain? What are their names? What is the CRS? The extent? The resolution?
3. Rename the layers: `fill_1` to `nir` (near-infrared), `fill_2` to `red`, `fill_3` to `green`. Plot the raster
4. Calculate the [Normalized difference vegetation index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index) (NDVI) based on near infrared and red layers: `ndvi = (nir - red)/(nir + red)`
5. Notice how the calculated `ndvi` is a raster itself. Assign name  `ndvi` to the raster layer you have just created
6. Plot `ndvi` and write it as a new GeoTIFF (*.tif) file: `ndvi_ename.tif`

## INTERMEZZO: big files? No problem

Big rasters? No problem! From [`raster` documentation](https://rspatial.github.io/raster/reference/raster-package.html):

  _The package can work with large files because the objects it creates from these files only contain information about the structure of the data, such as the number of rows and columns, the
spatial extent, and the filename, but it does not attempt to read all the cell values in memory. In computations with these objects, data is processed in chunks._

This holds true for `terra` and `stars` as well, of course.

# Challenge 3

Calculate a canopy height raster from a digital **terrain** model (DTM) and a digital **surface** model (DSM). In other words: `dtm` is the height of the terrain in meters while `dsm` is the height of the top of the vegetation canopy in meters. Both heights are measured using mean sea level as reference zero.

Read `20211125_dtm_ename.tif` and `20211125_dsm_ename.tif` as `dtm` and `dsm` respectively. This doesn't work:

```r
# canopy height model
chm <- dsm - dtm
```

How to fix it?

## Bonus challenge

### Appendices to challenge 1

1. Calculate the areal proportion of land cover classes in each of the Natura2000 protected areas. Note: `exact_extract()` should be combined with a function you have to write. It requires data manipulation knowledge (e.g. dplyr).
2. We do now something similarb as in challenge 1 but with continuous rasters. Calculate dataframe with min max and mean altitude for each Belgian province using `exact_extract()`. How to include the province name in the output? (code to get the data is provided in R script!). Tip: check the basic usage of this tutorial https://isciences.gitlab.io/exactextractr/#basic-usage

### Appendices to challenge 2

Add layers `nir` and `red` from `cir_ename` to GeoTIFF `ndvi_ename.tif`
