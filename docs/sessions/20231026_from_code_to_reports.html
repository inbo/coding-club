## Markdown, R Markdown, bookdown, INBOmd: help!

- Markdown: a markup language \* for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor (= you don't get what you see).
E.g. make text italic by surrounding it with underscores or asterisks, e.g. `__text__`
- R Markdown: a file type with extension `Rmd` to _knit_ text (in Markdown) and code (in R) together. Goal: generate high quality shareable reports.
- [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html): the R package to write R Markdown documents**.
- [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/): R package to make authoring _books_ or technical documents out of a series of R Markdown documents
- [INBOmd](https://github.com/inbo/INBOmd#readme): R package containing templates to generate reports, slides or posters with the corporate identity of INBO or the Flemish government.

<small>\** A markup language is a language that annotates text so that the computer can manipulate that text. Most markup languages are human-readable. More on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language#Descriptive_markup).<br>
\** * R Markdown is by default installed within RStudio!

# Challenge 0: R Markdown in a nutshell

- `File` ->  `New File` -> `R Markdown...` -> Title: "test", Author: your name, Output format: HTML (deafult)
- Switch to Visual Markdown Editor (VME) and try to write further (and say OOOHHH)
- Save it as `test.Rmd`
- **knit** it to create html (= `rmarkdown::render("test.Rmd")` in console)

# The YAML header: y a m l what???

The first lines between triple dashes (`---`) is our **header**, needed to configure the output to generate by setting up the title, the author, the output type, etc.

And why is it called a YAML header? Because it is written in YAML :-) YAML is a programming language typically used to write such kind of **configurations**.

Why do people use YAML for writing configurations files? Because YAML is very, very **human readable**.

```r

title: "test"
author: "Damiano Oldoni"

# Challenge 1

Convert the code below to a Rmd document called `1_geese_read_data.Rmd` and _knit_ it as html. Please, take care of:

1. Converting the comments to text
2. Show the library you need to load but avoid to show any **message** (errors or warnings are allowed). Tip: see [list](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#text-output) with all test-output chunk options. How to avoid showing **warnings** as well?
3. Do not show the code in lines 82-84 and 88-89 (about removing some rows). Tip: this is shown in `test.Rmd` (challenge 0) and in the list mentioned in previous tip.
4. Set date automatically in YAML header. [Tip](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/update-date.html)
5. Do you want always good looking data.frames (tables) with the smallest effort possible? Page them! [Tip](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#data-frame-printing)
6. Add a table of content. Allow the table of contents being always visible, even when the document is scrolled. [Tip](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#table-of-contents)
7. Add section numbers to the table of content. [Tip](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#section-numbering)

class: left, top

# Intermezzo 1

There are plenty chunk options. For example, do you want to restyle your code authomatically? Use chunk option: `tidy='styler'`. It will run `styler::style_text()` behind the screen. Handy!

background-image: url({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/background_challenge_2.png)
class: left, top

# Challenge 2

Put the code in challenge 2 in a second R Markdown document called `2_visualize_model_data.Rmd` and make an html document out of it. Take care of the following:

1. If you do it "blindly", you will get errors, probably at the very beginning: why? How to solve it?
2. Use tabbed sections where mentioned (static plots). Tip: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#tabbed-sections
3. With respect to plotting and modelling, the chunk codes can be quite long and so potentially distracting for the readers. Please, fold them. Readers can then choose to display them by clicking the fold buttons: Tip: check this [fold-show](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/fold-show.html) section.

class: left, top

# Intermezzo 2

Any solution you found for Challenge 2 is far from being an ideal solution! You have two options, depending on the length of your document/report/blogpost/...

1. Put everything in a Rmd document (typical for blogposts, tutorials)
2. Make a Rmd per chapter and bind all chapters together with bookdown!

Let's apply solution 2 to our case! First, make a new book with the RStudio Project Wizard (File > New Project > New Directory > Book project using bookdown) and select gitbook from the dropdown menu. Call the directory, and so, the project, `my_report_20231026`. More about it in [this](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html.html#gitbook-style) chapter of the bookdown guide. Notice you can _build_ your book via a "Buid book" option in the Build pane of RStudio (see screenshot below).

# Challenge 3

Try to convert the content of your two Rmd documents in the book we have just created. Follow these tips, from [Thierry's slides](https://inbo.github.io/inbomd_examples/inbomd_workshop/inbomd_workshop.pdf). Notice that some files are already present, you just need to edit them a little:

class: left, top

# Bonus challenge

Now you can become a pro!

1. Add a figure caption. Tip: fig.cap = "your caption" in chunk option
2. Add some cross references, e.g. try to refer to a section within another section and refer to a figure. Tip: change the output in YAML header from `html_document` to `html_document2`, a type of output specific of bookdown, not available in RMarkdown. This allows numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/equations. Handy!
3. Now you know how to create a _book_, you can understand the phylosophy behind the INBO package `INBOmd` and can fully understand the [slides](https://inbo.github.io/inbomd_examples/inbomd_workshop/inbomd_workshop.pdf) of Thierry! Give `INBOmd` a try by creating the same book as in challenge 3: your report is 100% INBO-styled, yeah! Tip: check `?INBOmd::report()` as well.

## Do you know that...

1. Many INBO tutorials are written in R markdown and then _knitted_ as markdown documents? See [example](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/spatial_wfs_services/).
2. Markdown is very popular to easily write webpages. Check the team [oscibio website](https://oscibio.inbo.be/) and the website of the Jekyll* template behind it: [Petridish](https://peterdesmet.com/petridish/)
3. [Data processing pipelines](https://trias-project.github.io/alien-plants-belgium/dwc_mapping.html) published as GitHub pages are R markdown documents?
4. The Hackmd pages we use at the INBO coding club follow markdown syntax? Yes, probably you know it!
5. The process of creating an unified checklist of alien species in Belgium (published on GBIF as the [GRIIS checklist of Belgium](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/6d9e952f-948c-4483-9807-575348147c7e)) is a bookdown [document](https://trias-project.github.io/unified-checklist/)?

<small>* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language (e.g; Markdown) and uses layouts (e.g. Petridsh) to create a static website.

## Quarto documents (.qmd): are they the future?

Do you know about [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) documents? Well, probably we all will write them within a year or two...

Quarto is*:

- A way to combine the (benefits of) R (R Markdown, bookdown, tidyverse packages) and Python (Jupyter Book, Jupyter notebooks, pandas, matplotlib) data science ecocystems
- A rewrite of RMarkdown with multilanguage as a first-class concern
- A way to get an accessible webpage AND a publication-ready PDF from the same source
- A really big wrapper around Pandoc (the document converter used to "knit" Rmd documents)
- Not a prototype anymore: tens of thousands of users already


Do you know that the [Communicate section](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/communicate) of the R for Data Science book focusses on Quarto and is written using Quarto?**

One thing is for sure: all effort you did up to now is not for nothing! Quarto is very similar to Rmd.

## Quarto documents (.qmd): are they the future?

The [getting started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) tutorial is the best start to learn Quarto.

Give it a try:

- `File` ->  `New File` -> `Quarto Document...` -> Title: "test", Output format: HTML (deafult)
- Visual Markdown Editor (VME) is used by default, but you can switch to `Source`
- **Render** it to create html (opened automatically in your browser as a Background job)

# The package of the month. Pieter's choice

[gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/) is a package to create wonderful-looking tables using R. It is also incredibly well documented. Currently, gt supports the HTML, LaTeX, and RTF output formats.
