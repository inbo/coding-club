## Coding club play tables

**Like** a card club, we will split us in different tables (aka _breakout rooms_) and we will help each other! We return all together after a fixed amount of time to discuss each challenge apart.

**Unlike** a card club, in our club there is no winner, neither within a table nor among tables!

# Download data and code

You can download the material of today:

- automatically via `inborutils::setup_codingclub_session()`*

- manually** from GitHub folders [coding-club/data/20210831](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/tree/master/data/20210831) and [coding-club/src/20210831](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/tree/master/src/20210831)

<br>
<small> __\* Note__: you can use the date in "YYYYMMDD" format to download the coding club material of a specific day, e.g. run `setup_codingclub_session("20201027")` to download the coding club material of October, 27 2020. If date is omitted, the date of today is used. For all options, check the [tutorial online](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_setup_codingclub_session/).</small>

# Challenge 1

Give a look at the [`ToothGrowth` dataset](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/ToothGrowth)

1. Plot length of odontoblasts (`len`) as function of the supplement (`supp`) using points
2. Plot length of odontoblasts (`len`) as function of the dose (`dose`) using points
3. Starting from 2, distinguish `supp` using points with different colors and different shapes
4. Starting from 3, change the y-axis label to "length (mm)", change the x-axis label to "dose (mg/day)", change the legend title to "supplement" and add a title to the graph, e.g. "The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs"
5. Set colors to "blue" for chilled plants and "indian red" for nonchilled

## Intermezzo. Aesthetics

This works:

```
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len, color = supp)) + geom_violin()
```

This works too:

```
ggplot(ToothGrowth) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = dose, y = len, color = supp))
```

What should I use? Both are good, but...
But what if you want to plot two or more geometries with *different* aesthetics?

# Challenge 2A

1. Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not red and transparency not correct? How to solve it?
```
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len, color = "blue", alpha = 0.3)) +
  geom_point()
```

2. With so many points it is hard to see the effect of `supp` and `dose` on `len`. A box plot ( `geom_boxplot()`) could help, but what's gone wrong with this code? The x , `dose`, doesn't make any sense. How to solve it?
```
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = dose, y = len, color = supp, group = supp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

# Challenge 2B

Let's work with dataset `Orange` containing data about the growth of some orange trees. The point plot on the left is difficult to understand. Smoother lines can help. Try to reproduce the right figure. Do not show the standard error for the smoothers at tree level and try to get the tree numbers in legend using an increasing order.

# Challenge 3A

Sometimes using colors, shapes, etc. is not sufficient: you would like to split data in a grid of subplots to ease interpretation. How to modify the code in the R script to show data of each plant forming a grid of 12 subplots as shown below?

# Challenge 3B

Let's use the `area_biotopes` dataset! The plot on the left is unreadable (see code in R script). The plot on the right is much better, isn't it? Try to get something similar* or even better!

# Bonus challenge

In challenge 1 we tried to understand the effect of `Type`  (`Quebec`, `Mississipi`) and `Treatment` (`chilled` , `nonchilled`) separately via box plots. Now we would like, still by means of a box plot, to see the effect of the interaction of these two variables together, so that we have four different situations (2 Type x 2 Treatment).
