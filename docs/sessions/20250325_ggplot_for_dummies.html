# Data and scripts description

Today we will work with two datasets:

- `occs_benelux` dataset. The dataset contains the number of GBIF occurrences in the Benelux countries (Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg) per year from 2000 up to 2024*. The dataset is available in the `20250325_occs_benelux.tsv` file. Challenges: 1, 2 and 3A.
- `species_be` dataset. The dataset contains the species observed in Belgium and its regions in 2025**. The dataset is available in the `20250325_species_in_BE.tsv` file. Challenges: 3B and bonus challenge.


R script:

- `20250325_challenges.R`: code to start with the challenges.

# ggplot recipe: data - mapping - geometry

![:scale 70%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20250325/20250325_ggplot_recipe.png)

The grammar of graphics! The ggplot2 package is based on the layered grammar of graphics, a concept introduced by Leland Wilkinson in 1999. The grammar of graphics is a system for building graphs by combining components, each of which represents a different aspect of the graph data.

# Choose the right data visualization

Not every type of data visualization is suitable for every data. The [Data Visualization Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) (non-code based) project can help you to choose the right plot for your data. For an R-oriented perspective, the ["from Data to Viz""](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) proejct can be a good alternative.

- How many variables do you have?
- Are they categorical (e.g. `country`: `BE`, `NL` or `LU`), numerical?

# Challenge 1

We will use `occs_benelux_animals`, a subset of `occs_benelux` containing only the  occurrences of animals. The code to create `occs_benelux_animals` from `occs_benelux` is provided!

1. Do a scatter plot (=points) with the number of occurrences (y) per year (x). Distinguish the countries by color.
2. Add a title (e.g. "GBIF occurrence records in the Benelux") and labels for the axes (e.g. "year" and "number of occurrences").
3. To better represent the data, use a logarithmic scale for the y-axis.
4. Add a smoother to the plot. Use "loess" method and color the smoother by country. Show the confidence interval (standard error).
5. This kind of data could be also represented by a bar plot. Try to do it (without smoother). The grammar of graphics makes this kind of change quite easy, isn't? What do you think about? Which one is more informative: the scatter plot of the bar plot? And why?

# Intermezzo: aesthetics

This works:

```r
ggplot(data = iris,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                     y = Petal.Length,
                     color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
```

This works too:

```r
ggplot(data = iris) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                           y = Petal.Length,
                           color = Species))
```

Both are good. Still, we have the feeling that the second version is used more often. Another option using pipe:

```r
iris %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                       y = Petal.Length,
                       color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
```

---
class: left, top

# Intermezzo: aesthetics

The only case where it is better to opt for the second option is when you plot two or more geometries with **different** aesthetics.
For example, plot pressure and temperature vs time* :

```r
# dummy dataset
press_temp <- tibble::tibble(
  year = c(2000:2004),
  press = c(1.0, 1.1, 1.4, 1.2, 1.6),
  temp = c(13.2, 15.1, 12.2, 11.8, 10.9)
)
ggplot(press_temp) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = press)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = temp), color = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~., name = "temperature")) +
  theme(axis.line.y.right = element_line(color = "red"),
        axis.text.y.right = element_text(color = "red"),
        axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "red"))
```

<br>
<small> __\* Note__: such kind of plot is an example of BAD PRACTICES, by the way!

# Challenge 2: life is better with colors 🌈

We will build upon the scatter plot of the previous challenge. Changing colors is a **scaling** operation.

1. Set colors **manual**ly. Use `"black"` for Belgium, `"skyblue"` for The Netherlands and `"indian red"` for Luxembourg. Hint: give a look to the cheatsheet.
2. A popular way of defining colours is by hex codes. Hex codes are an hash, `#`, followed by a combination of six characters - which can be any of the digits 0 - 9, or any of the letters A - F. There many tools to pick colors and get their hex codes. For example, [colorhexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/): enter the color names used above to get their correspondent hexcodes. Create same plot using the hexcodes.
3. You have just created a 3-color **palette**: a vector with colors. Thousands of already predefined palettes exist. Let's set the color automatically by using the famous viridis palette. The `viridis` palette is so famous that ggplot has its own [set of functions](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html) for dealing with it.
4. Use the [R Graph Gallery's color palette finder](https://r-graph-gallery.com/color-palette-finder) to explore palettes interactively. Pick a palette and use it in your plot. Tip: you could need to use the [{paletteer} package](https://pmassicotte.github.io/paletteer_gallery/), which collects many of these palettes together into a single R package.
5. Accessibility for people with color deficiencies is important. Use the [{colorblindr} package](https://github.com/clauswilke/colorblindr) to simulate how the plots you’ve just created may look to people with colour blindness. Tip: check section ["Accessible Choices"](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/colours-in-r/#accessible-choices) from Nicola Rennie's blogpost.

# Intermezzo: customize non-data components

You can personalize almost everything within your plots. ggplot2 provides some predefined themes via functions named `theme_*()`, e.g. `theme_bw()` for a white background with black lines. See more on the cheat sheet.


```r
ggplot(data = iris,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                     y = Petal.Length,
                     color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

---
class: left, top

# Intermezzo: customize non-data components

But you can also customize any non-data component via function `theme()`! Look at the help `?theme`. Notice the help functions `element_*()`, e.g. `element_line()`, `element_text()` and  `element_rect()` (rect stands for rectangle).

```r
ggplot(data = iris,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                     y = Petal.Length,
                     color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  # we love flashy plots!
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "yellow"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "blue", linewidth = 2))
```

class: left, top

# Intermezzo: customize non-data components

Do you know that INBO has its own theme? It's called [INBOtheme](https://inbo.github.io/INBOtheme/): it's a package. Install it, load it and all figures will authomatically have an INBO touch. Read the nice [tutorials](https://inbo.github.io/INBOtheme/articles/index.html) for more.

```r
library(INBOtheme)
ggplot(data = iris,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                     y = Petal.Length,
                     color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Iris dataset: Petal length vs Sepal length")
```

INBOtheme takes care of the quality of your plots: a message is returned if more than 4 colors are used. This is because using more than 4 colours might make the plot hard to read.

```
library(INBOtheme)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point()
> using more than 4 colours might make the plot hard to read
```

# Challenge 3A - faceting

Up to now we used `occs_benelux_animals` dataset. But how to visualize the data for each kingdom separately? No, we don't need to run a loop or something like that, thanks to the **faceting** feature of ggplot2. Check the cheatsheet.

1. Show scatter plots for each kingdom separately on one row.

2. Show scatter plots for each kingdom separately: 2 rows and 2 columns.

# Challenge 3B - one dataset, many valid plots

Based on `species_be`, let's show how many species have been observed in Belgium in 2025 for each order (column `order`) and IUCN red list category (column `iucnRedListCategory`). The code to get these counts (variable `n_species_per_order_iucn`) is provided. Use **bar plots**. Try reproducing the **faceting** shown in the screenshot below. As you can see some combinations are empty or almost empty, while few others are highly populated. How to deal with it? Choosing is not easy, but it's a good exercise to think about the best way to visualize your data and the story you want to tell.

# Bonus challenge - is ggplot enough?

Based on `species_be`, let's try to visualize how many species are present in Wallonia and/or Brussels and/or Flanders. The code to get the number of species per region (variable `n_species_region`) is provided. As you can see, there are 8 different combinations. What's the most appropriate graph to visualize the number of species in Flanders and/or Wallonia and/or Brussels? Is ggplot the best choice? If it can help, exclude the species in federal territory (sea), i.e. not belonging to any region, (`inWallonia` = `inBrussels` = `inFlanders` = `FALSE`).

Check https://www.data-to-viz.com/#explore to find the best graph for this situation.
