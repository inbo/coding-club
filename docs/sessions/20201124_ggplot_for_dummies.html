## Load the required packages

```
library(tidyverse)
```

---
class: left, middle

# Download data and code

Instead of downloading the files manually we have a new `inborutils` function called `setup_codingclub_session()`. If you have not used this function yet, restart your R session and update the `inborutils` package by running:

```r
if (!"remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("inbo/inborutils")
```

To download the coding club material of today, just run `setup_codingclub_session()`. In general, you can use the date in "YYYYMMDD" format , e.g. `setup_codingclub_session("20201027")`, to download the coding club material of October, 27. For all options, check the [tutorial online](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_setup_codingclub_session/).

Of course, you can still download [data](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20201124/) and [scripts](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20201124/) manually*!

# Challenge 1

Give a look at the [`CO2` dataset](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/CO2)

1. Plot `uptake` as function of `conc` using points
2. Distinguish by `Treatment` using points with different colors
3. and different shapes for `Type`
4. Change the y-axis label to "CO2 uptake"
5. Add a title to the graph, e.g. "Cold tolerance of the grass species Echinochloa crus-galli"
6. Use a logarithmic scale for the concentration
7. Set colors to "blue" for chilled plants and "indian red" for nonchilled

## Intermezzo. Aesthetics

This works:

```
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = Type)) + geom_violin()
```

This works too:

```
ggplot(CO2) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = Type))
```

What should I use? Both are good, but...
But what if you want to plot two or more geometries with *different* aesthetics?

# Challenge 2

1. Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not green and transparency not correct? How to solve it?
```
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = "green", alpha = 0.1)) +
  geom_point()
```
2. With so many points it is hard to see the effect of `treatment` or `type` on `uptake`. A box plot ( `geom_boxplot()`) could help, but what's gone wrong with this code? The x , `conc`, doesn't make any sense. How to solve it?
```
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = Treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

# Challenge 3A

Sometimes using colors, shapes, etc. is not sufficient: you would like to split data in a grid of subplots to ease interpretation. How to modify the code in the R script to show data of each plant forming a grid of 12 subplots as shown below?

# Challenge 3B

Let's use the `area_biotopes` dataset! The plot on the left is unreadable (see code in R script). The plot on the right is much better, isn't it? Try to get something similar* or even better!

<small>* __Note__: To get same color, run  [`library(INBOtheme)`](https://inbo.github.io/INBOtheme/)

# Bonus challenge

In challenge 1 we tried to understand the effect of `Type`  (`Quebec`, `Mississipi`) and `Treatment` (`chilled` , `nonchilled`) separately via box plots. Now we would like, still by means of a box plot, to see the effect of the interaction of these two variables together, so that we have four different situations (2 Type x 2 Treatment).
