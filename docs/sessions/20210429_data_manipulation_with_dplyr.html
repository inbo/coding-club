## Coding club tables

**Like** a card club, we will split us in different tables (aka _breakout rooms_) and we will help each other! We return all together after a fixed amount of time to discuss each challenge apart.

**Unlike** a card club, in our club there is no winner, neither within a table nor among tables!

# Download data and code

Today no R code script and only one data.frame to download

You can download the material:

- automatically via `inborutils::setup_codingclub_session()`*

- manually** from GitHub folder [coding-club/data/20210429](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20210429/)

<br>
<small> __\* Note__: you can use the date in "YYYYMMDD" format to download the coding club material of a specific day, e.g. run `setup_codingclub_session("20201027")` to download the coding club material of October, 27 2020. If date is omitted, the date of today is used. For all options, check the [tutorial online](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_setup_codingclub_session/).</small>

Today we will work with aquatic trap data!

Copy-paste the following code in a R script within your `coding-club` RStudio session and you can start with challenge 1. Happy coding.

```r
library(tidyverse)
# load aquatic trap data
df <- read_csv("./data/20210429/20210429_aquatictrap_data.csv")
```

# Challenge 1

1. Display the columns `id` and `weight_total`

2. Display the distinct values of `location_id` and `location_name`

3. Display data where both `weight` and `weight_total` are missing

4. Order the rows by number of trapped individuals (`n_individuals`).
How to order in increasing order? And in decreasing order?

4. Improve previous ordering by adding `date` as second variable (in case
same number of individuals occurs). Order both variables in descending order

5. Display `id`, `species`, `n_individuals`, `weight` and `weight_total` for
observations with non-empty values of `weight_total`

# Intermezzo: the _pipe_ %>%

From [dplyr documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html?q=pipe#the-pipe):

# Challenge 2

We can now proceed by cleaning `df`.

1. Set `weight_total` equal to `weight` if empty, remove column `weight` and
save as new object `df_cleaned`

2. Based on number of trapped individuals (`n_individuals`) and `weight_total`, calculate
the average weight for each catch and set it in a new column of `df_cleaned`
called `weight`. Put the columns `id`, `species`,
`n_individuals`, `n_traps` and all ones starting with "weight" ahead

3. Improve location_name by applying these changes:

original term | new term
--- | ---
`"Zandplaat Kastel"` | `"Kastel, zandplaat"`
`"Antwerpen, Kennedytunnel"` | DO NOT CHANGE
`"Grens Steendorp/Temse"` | `"Steendorp, grens met Temse"`

# Challenge 3

1. For each combination of species and location, calculate the `weight_mean`,
`depth_mean`, the `length_mean`, the minimum, the maximum and the total
number of trapped individuals (`min_n`, `max_n`, `tot_n`),
the date of the oldest and the most recent
campaign (`first_deployment_date`, `last_deployment_date`)

2. How many measurement campaigns for each date-location? Select the top 10

3. For each location, calculate number of successful catches, `n_success`,
(= `n_individuals` > 0 or `species` not `NA`) and number of species,  `n_species`

4. Calculate the statistics in 1 only for locations with more than 5000
successful catches
