## Coding club play tables

**Like** a card club, we will split us in different tables (aka _breakout rooms_) and we will help each other! We return all together after a fixed amount of time to discuss each challenge apart.

**Unlike** a card club, in our club there is no winner, neither within a table nor among tables!

# Download data and code

- Download everything automatically via `inborutils::setup_codingclub_session()`
- manually*, from [data/20220224](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20220224/) and [src/20220224](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20220224). Place the R script in your folder `src/20220224/` and data in `data/20220224/`.

In general, you can use the date in "YYYYMMDD" format , e.g. `setup_codingclub_session("20201027")`, to download the coding club material of October, 27 2020. For all options, check the [tutorial online](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_setup_codingclub_session/).


<small>* __Note__: check the getting started instructions on [how to download a single file](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/gettingstarted.html#each-session-setup)</small>

## Challenge 0

- Install packages*

```r
# install readr if not already installed
if (!"readr" %in% installed.packages()) {
  install.packages("readr")
}

# install readxl if not already installed
if (!"readxl" %in% installed.packages()) {
  install.packages("readxl")
}

if (!"googlesheets4" %in% installed.packages()) {
  install.packages("googlesheets4")
}
```

- Load packages

```r
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(googlesheets4)
```

<p>
<small>*Note: All these packages are part of the tidyverse _universe_, but only `readr` is loaded while running `library(tidyverse)`. </small>

# Challenge 1

2. Read the demographic evolution of Ghent districts from 1999 to 2009 from datafile [`20220224_gent_groeiperwijk.txt`](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20220224/20220224_gent_groeiperwijk.txt)
3. Read manta related data* from sheet `ALL DATA` of the Excel datafile [`20220224_manta_2014_2015.xlsx`](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20220224/20220224_manta_2014_2015.xlsx)
4. Something more difficult now! Read butterfly related data file [`20220224_butterflies_counts.txt`](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20220224/20220224_butterflies_counts.txt) with semicolon (;) as delimiter,
dot (.) as decimal mark** and question mark (?) as NA. Read only the first 500
rows.  Be sure column `Date` is parsed as datetime by using `format = "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S"`.

<small>* __Note__: first line contains metadata about the type of variables. This is done by grouping cells, which is not really computer readable, as it is an example of untidy data. Same for the use of colors in cells. In next coding club we will come back on this topic and how to make data both human and computer readable. Stay tuned!

** __Note__:  `read_csv2()` uses `;` for the delimiter and `,` for the decimal mark. Useful for standard MS Excel exports.

# INTERMEZZO: why readr?

Why using readr functions instead of the basic R read functions?

# INTERMEZZO: why readr?

Why using read_* functions instead of the basic R read.* functions?

![:scale 100%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20220224/20220224_readr_vs_basicR_02.png)


Still, notice you can solve this by specifying argument  `colClasses = c("numeric", "character"))`

# Challenge 2: googlesheets

[`googesheets4`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) needs access to your Google account. First time you use this package you will need to authorize it.
1. Read the sheet `HyaHoVrBl` from a googlesheet about [hyacint coverage in Ename](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qHcx3eEhAv6LBI9R2kmV4IHgxdBw_Eq1ho6yuvi2xJM/edit?usp=sharing) paying attention to import all columns correctly
2. Get metadata of the googlesheet in 1. Hint: use the cheatsheet
3. But what if you don't want to allow tidyverse API to get access to your INBO
Google account? Well, you can publish the sheet to the web as csv for example and then import it via `read_delim()` or `read_csv()`. Read the csv generated in this way by using this link:

```r
hyacint_cov_link <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTpyMEyzb_M8vrSFUSzTegR4czallWdSUsDCuivdUIwdy7g8PIfrEJtgGBIXPV2UKKRaIZxN7o2O085/pub?gid=1007047746&single=true&output=csv"
```

To publish, go to File -> Share -> Publish to the web

## INTERMEZZO: locale

A [locale](https://readr.tidyverse.org/articles/locales.html) encapsulates common options that vary between languages and localities.

```r
> Sys.localeconv()
    decimal_point     thousands_sep          grouping   int_curr_symbol   currency_symbol
              "."                ""                ""             "EUR"               "€"
mon_decimal_point mon_thousands_sep      mon_grouping     positive_sign     negative_sign
              ","               "."            "\003"                ""               "-"
  int_frac_digits       frac_digits     p_cs_precedes    p_sep_by_space     n_cs_precedes
              "2"               "2"               "1"               "1"               "1"
   n_sep_by_space       p_sign_posn       n_sign_posn
              "1"               "4"               "4"
```

Get locale for Dutch :-)

```r
> locale("nl")
<locale>
Numbers:  123,456.78
Formats:  %AD / %AT
Timezone: UTC
Encoding: UTF-8
<date_names>
Days:   zondag (zo), maandag (ma), dinsdag (di), woensdag (wo), donderdag (do), vrijdag (vr),
        zaterdag (za)
Months: januari (jan.), februari (feb.), maart (mrt.), april (apr.), mei (mei), juni (jun.), juli
        (jul.), augustus (aug.), september (sep.), oktober (okt.), november (nov.),
        december (dec.)
AM/PM:  a.m./p.m.
```

Which are the arguments you can set up with `locale()`. Check it with `?readr::locale()`.

## INTERMEZZO: encoding*

Some concepts:

- Words and sentences in text are created from __characters__
- Characters that are needed for a specific purpose are grouped into a __character set__. Example: Unicode
- The characters are stored in the computer as one or more __bytes__
- The (character) encoding is a __set of mappings__ between the bytes in the computer and the characters in the character set. Without it, the data looks like garbage. Example: UTF-8
- __UTF-8__ is the most widely used way to represent Unicode text. Please, use it always
- But, UTF-8 is only one of the possible ways of encoding Unicode characters: a character can actually be mapped to different byte sequences, depending on which encoding was used for the document

<small>* __Note__: this page is an extract from the article [Character encodings for beginners](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding)</small>

# Challenge 3

Read the data file [`20220224_rainfall_waterloo.txt`](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20220224/20220224_rainfall_waterloo.txt) containing meteorological data from Waterloo in Walloon language and using apex (') as grouping mark (e.g. 1000 -> 1'000)

Be aware of these three aspects:

1. Parse column `Hour` as a column containing numbers
2. Parse column `Absolute Value` as a numeric column paying attention to define the right  `grouping_mark`. Hint: check the structure of a typical locale, e.g. nl <- locale("nl")
3. Parse the column `Date` as a date column. Hint: look at the
[`locale` vignette](https://readr.tidyverse.org/articles/locales.html) of readr package and again
check the structure of a typical _locale_. For finding the right datetime
parsing, this is a nice datetime
[format specifications compendium](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/dates.html)

These are the days, months and correspondent abbreviations in Walloon:

```r
days_walloon <- c("londi", "mårdi", "mierkidi", "djudi", "vénrdi",
  "semdi", "dimegne")
months_walloon <- c("djanvî","fevrî", "måss", "avri", "may", "djun", "djulete",
                    "awousse","setimbre", "octôbe", "nôvimbe", "decimbe")
days_abbr_walloon <- c("lon", "mår", "mie", "dju", "vén", "sem", "dim")
months_abbr_walloon <- c("djan","fev", "mås", "avr", "may", "djun", "djul",
                         "awou","set", "oct", "nôv", "dec")
```

class: left, top

# Third challenge: Encoding

In a locale you can also specify the encoding used while saving a file, e.g.

```r
read_tsv(filename, locale = locale(encoding = "UTF-8"))
```

By default readr package uses `UTF-8` encoding and you are 99% of the time happy with it.  A typical problem is that sometimes in Western Europe "old" latin-1 (iso8859-1) encoding is used. The same can happen in other regions of the world where old encodings could be  used. Which encodings are supported by your machine in R? Run `iconvlist()`.

1. Read file `20220224_latin-1_character_set.txt`
2. Read file `20220224_turkish_iso8859-9.txt`. Use View() to open the data.frame. Do you get the same while printing the data.frame on Console? Why?
