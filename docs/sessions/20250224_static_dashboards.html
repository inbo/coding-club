# Data and scripts description

1. [20250224_craywatch_cleaned.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20250224/20250224_craywatch_cleaned.txt): tab separated text file with GBIF observations of 6 invasive alien crayfishes in Flanders. Derived from [10.15468/dl.pszsrh](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.pszsrh). The query the GBIF download was based on, is the same query running realtime to show the layer "Nieuwe waarnemingen" (new observations) in the [craywatch map](https://craywatch.inbo.be/kaart/).
2. [20250224_](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20250224/20250224_): geopackage with the Flemish provinces.

3. [20250224_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20250224/20250224_challenges.R): R script to start with.

# Challenge 1: one page dashboard

Let's create a (static) dashboard called "" using [flexdashboard](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/index.html).

1. Use the code in 20250224_challenges.R under "#### Challenge 1" to generate a  dashboard. Use the [Tabset Column](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/articles/layouts.html#tabset-column) layout. Set the first histogram (catches per year and province) on the left. On the right, display two bar charts (catches per province and catches per year) as a set of 2 tabs.
2. Replace "Chart1", "Chart2" and "Chart3" with better titles.
3. Add a second page with catch analysis at species level. Check the [Multiple pages](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/articles/layouts.html#multiple-pages) section in the documentation. Divide the dashboard in two columns: on the left the catches per year and species, on the right the data with the fitted model.
4. Replace "Page1" and "Page2" with better titles.
5. A dashboard is not a dashboard without some interactive maps :-) Use the code under "# Maps" to add a third page with the heatmap and the leaflet map. Put each of them in a separate column.

Please, feel free to experiment with other layouts. Enjoy flexdashboard!
