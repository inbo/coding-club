# Introduction: coding is cooking

Coding is cooking! üç≤ ü•ò Working with functions is like using a food processor (NL: keukenrobot). A **function** is like a **recipe**.

- With a food processor, you can use preset recipes, but you can also create your own recipes.
- Working with functions, you can use preset functions (`names()`, `length()`, `median()`, ...), but you can also create your own functions.

# Introduction: coding is cooking

Think to have a food processor here in front of you:
- You can define your own **recipe** by defining the needed **ingredients**, the **actions** to perform and then save it for later use by giving it a **name**.
- You can define your own **function** by defining the needed **input arguments**, the **code** to execute and then save it for later use by giving it a **name**.

# Introduction: coding is cooking

My recipe, ehum, function:

```
make_bread <- function(grains, yeast, water, salt) {
    # Code to generate `bread`.
    # The code here can be easy (easy bread recipes do exist)
    # or quite complex (complex bread recipes do exist too)
    bread <- grains + yeast + water + salt
    return(bread)
}
```

---
class: left, top

# Introduction: coding is cooking

- When ready, you can add ingredients to the food processor, select your own recipe, press `Play` and you will get the **food**.
- When ready, you can pass inputs to the function, call your own function, press `Enter` and you will get the **output**.

```
# Prepare ingredients on the table = Define input values
my_grains <- 20
my_yeast <- 1
my_water <- 2
my_salt <- 3

# Add ingredients in the food processor = Pass input values to arguments of the function
my_bread <- make_bread(grains = my_grains, yeast = my_yeast, water = my_yeast, salt = my_yeast) # Press `Enter`
my_bread
```

---
class: left, top

# Introduction: coding is cooking

You can use:
- the same recipe with different ingredients
- the same function with different input arguments

```
# Use the recipe with different (amount of) ingredients
bread1 <- make_bread(grains = grains1, yeast = yeast1, water = water1, salt = salt1)
bread2 <- make_bread(grains = grains2, yeast = yeast2, water = water2, salt = salt2)
```

You can have:
- different recipes using the same ingredients
- different functions using the same input arguments

```
# Make savory pie dough with the same ingredients
savory_pie_dough1 <- make_savory_pie_dough(grains = grains1, yeast  = yeast1, water = water1, salt = salt1)
# Make focaccia with the same ingredients
focaccia1 <- make_focaccia(grains = grains1, yeast = yeast1, water = water1, salt = salt1)
```

# Introduction: When do we need functions?

If both these conditions are true:

- you have to `"do something"` longer than one line of code
- you need to `"do something"` at least for two different inputs


---
class: left, top

# Introduction: When should we use functions?

- the `"do something"` is actually a workflow: split it in (small) functions
- the `"do something"` is very short (e.g. a one-line formula) but often used: putting it in a function will give it an understandable name and will avoid typos

# Introduction: good names

Functions are the building blocks of your data analysis: give your functions understandable and short enough names. It's better for future-you, it's better for everybody. Naming things is an art, a special skill: for some people is a job itself!

From the B-Cubed software development guide (section [Naming functions](https://docs.b-cubed.eu/dev-guide/#r-function-naming)):

_Use **verbs** to name functions whenever possible, this is a clear indication that a function does something, in contrast to other objects. For more guidance please refer to the tidyverse style guide [section on functions](https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html#naming). Keep in mind that the name of the function should describe what it does as closely as possible._

_If you find this difficult, consider if your function isn‚Äôt doing too much. Ideally a function should only do one thing, and only return one thing._


---
class: left, top

# Introduction: multiple outputs?

- Can your recipe prepare different meals at the same time? No.
- Can a R function return multiple outputs? No. R functions return only **one output**: `return(my_meal)`

But you can put your outputs (e.g. a data.frame and a plot) in a list. A named list will make everybody and the future-you very happy: documentation begins by naming things :-)

```r
make_doughs <- function(grains, yeast, water, salt) {
  # Code to generate `bread` and `focaccia`
  bread <- grains + yeast + water + salt
  focaccia <- grains + 1.5 * yeast + 0.7 * water + 2 * salt
  # Combine bread and focaccia as a list of doughs
  doughs <- list(bread = bread, focaccia = focaccia)
  return(doughs)
}

doughs <- make_doughs(grains = 20, yeast = 1, water = 2, salt = 3)
doughs$bread
> 26
doughs$focaccia
> 28.9
```

# Challenge 0

Let's warm up. In the intro we wrote the function `make_doughs()`:

```
make_doughs <- function(grains, yeast, water, salt) {
  # Code to generate `bread` and `focaccia`
  bread <- grains + yeast + water + salt
  focaccia <- grains + 1.5 * yeast + 0.7 * water + 2 * salt
  # Combine bread and focaccia as a list of doughs
  doughs <- list(bread = bread, focaccia = focaccia)
  return(doughs)
}
```

If you have only this function, you are not allowed to prepare only bread, or only focaccia. It's a pity, isn't it? Programmers say that this function needs a _refactoring_, an improvement as the function is not _atomic_*, it does too much. We can rewrite it as the composition of two _atomic_ functions: `make_bread()` and `make_focaccia()`.

1. Write `make_bread()` and `make_focaccia()`. They return bread and focaccia respectively.
2. Use them to rewrite `make_doughs()`.

<br>
<small> \* Atomic = not divisible in smaller parts. Ok, atoms are divisible in smaller parts, but we are not in the atomic world :-) </small>

# The Antwerp trilogy: Ladybeetles, Grasshoppers, and Data Science

Once upon a time there was a biologist, Dorothy*. She received in January 2011 observations of the asian ladybeetle (_Harmonia axyridis_) collected in the surroundings of Antwerp. These observations are stored in [20250626_harmonia_axyridis_2010.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20250626/20250626_harmonia_axyridis_2010.txt). She wrote some code to read the observations, do some data wrangling and plot the results. You can find the code in [20250626_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20250626/20250626_challenges.R).

What seemed to be a one-shot anlysis, becomes very soon something more: she receives a similar file from another contractor containing observations of the bow-winged grasshopper (_Chorthippus biguttulus_) collected in the same area: [20250626_chorthippus_biguttulus_2010.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20250626/20250626_chorthippus_biguttulus_2010.txt).

<br>
<small> __\* The fictive Dorothy character is a tribute to [Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Hodgkin), a British chemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. She was a pioneer in the field of X-ray crystallography to study interesting biological molecules. Among others, she discovered the structure of the vitamine B12. </small>

# The Antwerp trilogy: Ladybeetles, Grasshoppers, and Data Science

Dorothy also learns that she will have to redo the same analysis in the future, for sure on observations of the Asian ladybeetle, [20250626_harmonia_axyridis_2011.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20250626/20250626_harmonia_axyridis_2011.txt)

And, she is afraid, new data of bow-winged grasshopper will find her sooner or later. I think you can find yourself in the role of Dorothy.

# Best practices and suggestions

- Leave the given script (`20250626_challenges.R`) as it is, so that you can always refer to it, while writing the functions.

- Create a new file, e.g. `20250626_functions.R`: it contains only the functions. It's like a cookbook with the recipes.

- Create a new file, e.g. `20250626_workflow.R`: it contains your code which will call the functions.

- **Source** `20250626_challenges.R`, e.g. run `source("./src/20250626/20250626_functions.R")` or just click the "Source" button in RStudio, everytime you change the functions. This way you can test your functions while writing them.

# Intermezzo 1: what happens in the function stays in the function!

Unfortunately not in R :-/

```r
grains <- 30
make_tricky_bread <- function(yeast, water, salt) {
  # `grains` is not defined as argument! Sitll, the function works...
  bread <- grains + yeast + water + salt
  return(bread)
}

make_tricky_bread(1, 10, 2)
#> [1] 43
make_tricky_bread(2, 15, 5)
#> [1] 52
make_tricky_bread(0.5, 20, 3.5)
#> [1] 54
```

Even if it works, it is **bad** practice as it can end up in wrong results.*
Better an error than a wrong result, right? So, please, be careful!

# Intermezzo 2: document with style

C. Bukowski once wrote that [_"Style is the answer to everything"_](https://genius.com/Charles-bukowski-style-annotated).

Function documentation is essential while using R. How many times did you use the help (`?function_name`) in your daily woRk? So, let's document our functions with style!

Stylish documentation can be done by following the [Roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/index.html) conventions as programmers writing functions for R packages do. Again, future-you and your colleagues will praise you. Do you know you can use the [`docstring`](https://github.com/dasonk/docstring) package to create help pages of your functions even if they are not in a package?

Speaking about style, we, at INBO, follow the official and very stylish [INBO Styleguide for R code](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/styleguide_r_code/). Another good source of inspiration is the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html). In between, you can use the [B-cubed software development guide](https://docs.b-cubed.eu/dev-guide/) mostly written by our colleague, Pieter.

# Intermezzo 2: document with style

You can create a roxygen documentation Skeleton via `Code` -> `Insert Roxygen Skeleton`. Move that part in your stand-alone function and write your documentation.

```r
install.packages("docstring")
library(docstring)

make_bread <- function(grains, yeast, water, salt) {
  #' Make bread
  #'
  #' Function to make bread out of grains, yeast, water and salt.
  #'
  #' @param grains Numeric vector containing the amount of grains.
  #' @param yeast Numeric vector containing the amount of yeast.
  #' @param water Numeric vector containing the amount of water.
  #' @param salt Numeric vector containing the amount of salt.
  #'
  #' @return Numeric vector containing the amount of bread.
  #'
  #' @examples
  #' # Make bread with 20 grains, 1 yeast, 2 water and 3 salt
  #' make_bread(20, 1, 2, 3)
  bread <- grains + yeast + water + salt
    return(bread)
  return(output)
}
```

# The package of the month - Ra√Øsa's choice: legendry

The goal of [legendry](https://teunbrand.github.io/legendry/) is to provide additional guide functionality to the ggplot2 ecosystem. It provides a set of functions to create guides and legends for ggplot2 plots, which can be useful when you want to customize their appearance or when you want to create legends for plots that do not have a built-in legend. See the very well-written [guided tour](https://teunbrand.github.io/legendry/articles/tour.html).
