class: left, top

# Challenge 1

1. Make a bar chart with the number of observations of rodents in Belgium per `year`. Tip: check the difference between `geom_bar()` and `geom_col()`, e.g. via help `?geom_bar`.
2. Change x and y labels to "Year" and "number of observations" respectively.
3. Add the title "Evolution of rodents in Belgium" to the plot.
4. Show only data from 2000.
5. **Fill** all bars with color blue and set contour **color** to red.
6. Sometimes, it is adviced to bin data to deal better with outliers and show trends. In this case, group years in bins of 5 years.

# Intermezzo: aesthetics


```r
ggplot(data = rodentia, mapping = aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar()

```

This works too:

```r
ggplot(data = rodentia) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = year))
```

Both are good. Still, we have the feeling that the second version is used more often.


---
class: left, top

# Intermezzo: aesthetics

The only case where it is better to opt for the second option is when you plot two or more geometries with **different** aesthetics.
For example, plot pressure and temperature vs time* :

```r
# dummy dataset
press_temp <- tibble::tibble(
  year = c(2000:2004),
  press = c(1.0, 1.1, 1.4, 1.2, 1.6),
  temp = c(13.2, 15.1, 12.2, 11.8, 10.9)
)
ggplot(press_temp) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = press)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = temp), color = "red") +
  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~., name = "temperature")) +
  theme(axis.line.y.right = element_line(color = "red"),
        axis.text.y.right = element_text(color = "red"),
        axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "red"))
```

<br>
<small> __\* Note__: such kind of plot is an example of BAD PRACTICES, by the way!

# Challenge 2A

1. Make a bar chart plot similar to the one in challenge 1.1 with year on the x-axis, but split the bars at genus level, for example by filling them using different colors. How are displayed the bars, by default?
2. Try other ways to "adjust" the bars. Tip: check the [positon adjustment section](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#position-adjustment) section in ggplot2 reference website.
3. How to split the bar chart in subplots based on family? Set a "free" scale.

# Challenge 2B

Bar charts or histograms are a good solution for displaying data where x is a discrete variable, in our case `year`. But we could actually think of year as a continuous variable. And so, points and lines could be a nice alternative.

After running the provided code:

1. Create a plot showing the number of observations of Ondatra zibeticus and Rattus norvegicus. Use both points and lines and distinguish the two species via color.
2. Typically, points are combined with a line showing the trend, calculated via a smoother function. ggplot helps us enormously to model and smooth our data. Try different smoother methods.


Question for the staticians in the room and at home: what is the best smoother function and parameters to use in this case?

# Intermezzo: customize non-data components


You can personalize almost everything within your plots. ggplot2 provides some predefined themes via functions named `theme_*()`, e.g. `theme_bw()` for a white background with black lines. See more on the cheat sheet.


```r
ggplot(data = rodentia, mapping = aes(x = year)) +
    geom_bar() + theme_bw()
```

But you can also customize any non-data component via function `theme()`! Look at the help `?theme`. Notice the help functions `element_*()`, e.g. `element_line()`, `element_text()` and  `element_rect()` (rect stands for rectangle).

```r
ggplot(data = rodentia, mapping = aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar() +
  # we love flashy plots!
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "green"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "blue", linewidth = 2))
```

# Intermezzo: customize non-data components

Do you know that INBO has its own theme? It's called [INBOtheme](https://inbo.github.io/INBOtheme/): it's a package. Install it, load it and all figures will authomatically have an INBO touch. Read the nice [tutorials](https://inbo.github.io/INBOtheme/articles/index.html) for more.

```r
library(INBOtheme)
ggplot(data = rodentia, mapping = aes(x = year)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle(label = "Temporal distribution of rodents observations in Belgium")
```

INBOtheme takes care of the quality of your plots: a warning is returned if more than 4 colors are used.

```
library(INBOtheme)
ggplot(data = rodentia, mapping = aes(x = year, fill = family)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle(label = "Temporal distribution of rodents observations in Belgium")
> using more than 4 colours might make the plot hard to read
```

To find the most appropriate graph for our data: [from Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) can definitely help us.

# Challenge 3

Let's use the [R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) as a source of inspiration to visualize data about rodents in Belgium from 1800 and 2000.

- Let's start showing the distribution of the observed `species` per `year`. Try to use INBO colors or the viridis palette. Try for example boxplots, violin plots, ridgeplots.
- Are all these plots meaningful while showing the distribution per `month` instead of `year`?
- Piecharts are not done in scientific papers, BUT they are perfectly accetable in presentations. They can be the best choice even! In our case, a piechart is a good idea for showing that two genera have the absolute majority of observations of rodents collected in Belgium up to 2020. All the other genera should be put together as "Other". Try to make your best piechart ever :-)

For the staticians who love astonishing plots, check what you can do using [violin plots with ggstatsplot](https://r-graph-gallery.com/web-violinplot-with-ggstatsplot.html)* or how to show uncertainty with [ggdist](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/).

# The package of the month: Emma's choice

[ggpattern](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/ggpattern/index.html) can be definitely funny, but it can be also the cherry on top :-) Just think to add rodents pictures for each species on each bar.

# The package of the month: Pieter's choice

If you forget how to create plots with ggplot (it happens frequently, no worries!), the RStudio's addin esquisse can help you to generate plots with few clicks. The [getting started](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/esquisse/vignettes/get-started.html) vignette is a very handy tutorial on how to use esquisse. And by exporting the code behind the plot we have just created, we will learn a lot, for sure!
