# Debugging first rule

Read carefully the error message and search on the web: let's google the error! Nowadays, you would maybe use Artificial Intelligence tools as:
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) from Open AI
- [Microsoft copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) from Microsoft
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) from Google
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/) from Anthropic (public-benefit company founded by former members of OpenAI, siblings Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei)
- [Blackbox](https://www.blackbox.ai/)* from Course Connecte Inc. (Canada), specific for coding

<small> \* Thanks Falk for the tip! Added after giving the coding club.</small>

# Debugging and AI

Can AI tools help you to detect and solve bugs? YES. However, keep in mind these aspects:

- proposed solution is not always working or right. The chatbot tends to please you by almost always proposing some code even if the answer is out of scope (the chatbot didn't understand the error you submitted).
- Spend time to better explain the issue to the chatbot. This way to solve bugs is called ITERATIVE*.
- providing a basic example can also improve the quality of the returned answer.

<br>
<small><left>\* Old school "googling" is at first instance a SEQUENTIAL approach. You surf among the links returned by the search browser and you start to read/apply the proposed solutions.</left></small>

# AI working group at INBO

Do you know there is a new INBO working group dedicated to AI? It will explore and evaluate the AI needs of the INBO researchers and the AI tools we are already using. Are they good enough? Are they worth the money? How open are they? What about environmental concerns (energy consumption, CO2 emission)?

- A 3-month proof period has been launched for testing some AI tools.
- INBO organised some info sessions already and workshops about AI and will continue to do it. Do we need a specific info session or workshop about **coding with AI**? Let's speak about it!

For more questions, please ask Hans, Aaike or other members of the AI workgroup.

# Debugging first rule

Read carefully the error message and search on the web. Let's train our eyes!

Example 1

```
Error in `mutate()`:
ℹ In argument: `delta_t = as.numeric(as.duration(time_first_dist_to_use -
  departure))`.
Caused by error in `as.duration()`:
! could not find function "as.duration"
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.
```

# Debugging first rule

Read carefully the error message and search on the web. Let's train our eyes!

Example 3: error is far from being informative for "normal" people

  m < mean(data)
  v <- var(data)
  s <- v/m
  a <- m/s
  return(list(a=a,s=s))
}
```

```
my_gamma_est(cats$Hwt)
Error in my_gamma_est(cats$Hwt) :
  'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double'
```

# From `print()` to debugging

If you are addicted to `print()`, the first detox is `browser()`. From its documentation:

> Interrupt the execution of an expression and allow the inspection of the environment where `browser` was called from.

Drawback: as `print()`, you need to clean your code by removing all `browser()` you inserted.

---
class: left, top

## Why debugging?

- Save time: "debugging" using `print()` is time consumming  + you have to clean up your code after
- Versatile: you can jump in **loops**, in **if-else** statements, in **functions**, you can proceed line by line and check the environment your code lives in at that precise moment.

# A memory aid

## Traceback your code

`traceback` your code to find where it stops to work.

In RStudio: **Debug** pane -> **On Error** -> **Error Inspector** and then click on **Show Traceback** in the error message <p>
![:scale 100%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20240827/20240827_livecoding_show_traceback.png)</p>

In basic R:

```r
options(error = "traceback") # Trace the error back, better than options(error = "message")
```

# A memory aid

## Debug your code: activate debugging mode

### 1st alternative

Source the file with the functions only and set breakpoints (red circles) where you think something wrong happens. Setting a breakpoint is exactly the same as typing `browser()`!

# A memory aid

## Debug your code: activate debugging mode

### 2nd alternative

Activate debugging mode on a specific function by using `debug(function_name)` or `debugonce(function_name)`.

```r
debug(calc_var) # or debugonce(calc_var)
```

Once this function is debugged, run `undebug(function_name)`.

---

# A memory aid

## Debug your code: work in debugging mode

Once you are in debugging mode, use **Next** (n) to move to next line, **Continue** (c) to go to next breakpoint (red circles)

# 123 magic

Write down a positive integer on a piece of paper:

```
886328712442992
```

Count up the number of even and odd digits, and the total number of digits:

```
10 5 15
```

String the digits of those three numbers together to make a new number:

```
10515
```

Perform the same operation on the obtained number:

```
1 4 5 ⟶ 145
```

And keep iterating:

```
1 2 3 ⟶ 123
```

You'll always arrive at the number 123!

# Intermezzo: defensive programming

Debugging starts already while writing code! Defensive programming is the best way to solve many (future) bugs: the future-you will praise you.

1. Add pre-conditions to your functions to avoid unexpected and unpredictable errors in later stages (**fail fast principle**: stop the current operation as soon as any unexpected error occurs)
```r
# PSEUDOCODE !!
if (date < today) stop("Date is too early");
if (class input != numeric vector) stop("Invalid type of input: only numeric vectors allowed.")
```

2. Assert statements to validate output at intermediate steps, e.g. output of third party libraries that you use in your project.

---
class: left, top

# Intermezzo: defensive programming

Example: apply defensive programming to the `custom_min()` function here below to avoid unexpected  behaviors:

```
# Customized `min()` function for NUMERIC(!) vectors
# to avoid warning while calculating min() of empty vectors
custom_min <- function(x) {
  if (length(x)>0) min(x) else NA
}
> custom_min(c("e", "r", "a")) # passing chars should return an error
[1] "a"
```

---
class: left, top

# Intermezzo: defensive programming - example

The package [assertthat](https://rdocumentation.org/packages/assertthat/versions/0.2.1) is very useful while applying defensive programming in your coding life. What we do is adding assertion(s) to our function.

```
library(assertthat)
# Customized `min()` function for NUMERIC(!) vectors
# to avoid warning while calculating min() of empty vectors
custom_min <- function(x) {
  # check x argument (assertion)
  assertthat::assert_that(
    is.numeric(x),
    msg = "Invalid type of input: only numeric vectors allowed."
  )
  # function core follows
  if (length(x)>0) min(x) else NA
}

# Only numeric input are allowed, error arises otherwise
custom_min(c("a", "b"))
Error: Invalid type of input: only numeric vectors allowed.
```

# Challenge 3 - Debug & defensive programming

Let's move to something more familiar: eels tagging data.

The function `get_migrations()` (code provided) works nicely in example 1, but it fails in other examples. Try to understand what is going wrong, add a series of checks (assertions) to fail "fast" and "nicely" and eventually solve the bugs.

# Tips: smaller the better

1. Build up code in small pieces, testing along the way, step by step
1. Make big changes in small steps
1. Write short functions: easier to debug, easier to understand

---
class: left, top

# Tips: do not code so _hard_

1. Do not __hard__code numbers: use variables instead (number of iterations, parameter values in simulations, ...). Easier to read and reduce the amount of potential bugs when you use the same number multiple times.
1. Avoid using **global variables** in your function
```r
txt <- "INBO"
b <- function(adjective) {
  paste(txt, "is", adjective)
}
> my_function("fantastic")
[1] "INBO is fantastic"
```
2. Avoid reusing **global variables** names in your function: very confusing and prone to bugs.
```r
txt <- "INBO"
my_function <- function() {
  txt <- "fantastic"
  paste("coding together is", txt)
}
> my_function()
[1] "coding together is fantastic"
> txt
[1] "INBO"
```

# Tips: optimize your code

We are typically lazy, aren't we?

A: "Does your code run?"

B: "Yes!"

A: "But it takes hours and GBs of memory!"

B: "I don't mind, it runs after all ..."

However, this kind of code could easily crash when running on bigger datasets.

# The packages of the month. Damiano's choice

- [**errorist**](https://r-pkg.thecoatlessprofessor.com/errorist/index.html): automatically search errors and warnings the second they arise by opening a browser tab with a Google search. Built upon the more flexible [**searcher**](https://r-pkg.thecoatlessprofessor.com/searcher/) package.
- [**naniar**](https://naniar.njtierney.com/): unexpected missing data are a very typical source of bugs. The naniar package provides an elegant solution to handle them.
- [**skimr**](https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/): a better knowledge of the data reduces sensibly the time spent to locate bugs. skimr does summary statistics which conforms to the [principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment), displaying summary statistics the user can skim quickly to understand their data. It's an R Open Science labelled package!
