# Introduction: sp package

Once upon a time...

![:scale 90%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20221025/20221025_sp_package.png)

Still, this package has been used by a lot of researchers/developers.

# Download data and code

Today we will use an R script and some datasets. Download* the R script in `src/20221025/` and datasets in `data/20221025/`.

- R script: [20221025_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20221025/20221025_challenges.R)
- Dataset with GBIF observations of water primrose (EN) / waterteunisbloem (NL) (_Ludwigia grandiflora_) in Flanders from 2021** [20221025_ludwigia_aquaticum.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20221025/20221025_Ludwigia_grandiflora.txt).

## Spatial coordinates

Two types of spatial coordinates:
- **projected** (or Cartesian) coordinates: refer to points on a flat space. The coordinates are the distance along the x and y axis
- **unprojected** or **geographic** coordinates: refer to angles (latitude, longitude) pointing to locations on a sphere (or ellipsoid).

For the math lovers: the flat space is also referred to as R<sup>2</sup>, the sphere as S<sup>2</sup>.

No geospatial data without specifying the **Coordinate Reference System** (CRS) you work with!

And what is a projection? A way to visualize stuff on a map (flat space).

# Challenge 1

Using the cheatsheet:

1. Transform `ludwigia_df` to a geospatial data.frame using `sf` package. Note that
GBIF data are stored using WGS 84. Hint: find first which numeric code is associated with WGS84 coordinate reference system and use the cheatsheet.
2. How many layers does the  geospatial file `20221025_protected_areas.gpkg` contain?
3. Read the layer `ps_hbtrl`: call it `prot_areas`
4. What is the CRS declared by user? Does it coincide with the real Geographic Coordinate Reference System (GEOCRS)?
5. Are the CRS of `prot_areas` and `spatial_ludwigia_df` the same?
6. Read the Belgian provinces rds file as `20221025_be_provinces_sp` (the code is given!). What is the class of this variable? From which package? How to transform it to a sf object?
7. Extract the Flemish provinces. Hint: do it as you would do it in a standard data.frame. The motto of the sf package is "Spatial data ... simplified" for a reason!

### CRS by EPSG codes

A common way to specify the CRS is by providing the EPSG (numeric) code. EPSG stands for European Petroleum Survey Group and is an organization that maintains a geodetic parameter database with standard codes, the EPSG codes, for coordinate systems, datums, spheroids, units and such alike.  There are a lot of EPSG codes! Full list: https://spatialreference.org/

# Challenge 2

1. Transform both `prot_areas` and `spatial_ludwigia_df` to [European Terrestrial Reference System 1989](https://epsg.io/3035)(EPSG: 3035), the coordinate reference system used at EU level
2. Write the transformed data as a geopackage file called `prot_areas_and_ludwigia_3035.gpkg` with two layers: the first called `prot_areas`, containing the protected areas, the second layer, `ludwigia_obs`, containing the observations of parrot's-feather
3. Due to spatial uncertainty (gridded data, GPS uncertainty, etc.) observations
 should not be idealized as points in space, but as circles. Create such circles
 using the values store in column `coordinateUncertaintyInMeters` for
 `spatial_ludwigia_df_3035`

## INTERMEZZO - what happened in 2020?

Up to version 0.9.x `sf` returned warnings to the user when it was doing R<sup>2</sup> flat computations with data using geographical coordinates (spherical coords, e.g. WGS84) with messages like

```
although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_intersects assumes that they are planar
```

Starting with version 1.0, `sf` uses the new package `s2` (Dunnington, Pebesma, Rubak 2020) for **spherical geometry**! They made our life much easier. Nice to know: s2 package is a wrapper around the C++ `s2geometry` library, written by Google and used e.g. in Google Maps, Google Earth Engine, Bigquery GIS.

More info in the vignette [Spherical geometry in sf using s2geometry](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf7.html).

# Challenge 3

Using data saved in CRS 3035:

1. Find which observations, as points, are _contained_ in each protected area?
2. But we should better check which observations, as circles (!), _intersect_ each protected area. How to do it?
3. So, how many observations in the "Demervallei"?
4. Sometimes it's interesting to calculate the centroid of a polygon, e.g. for visualizations. Easy by using sf function `st_centroids()`. However, you get an error while calculating the centroids of `prot_areas`. What does it mean? How to solve the problem?

# Bonus challenge

1. How to get only the observations, as circles, **totally** contained in protected areas? Hint: check the cheat sheet
2. Not a sf question, but still nice to solve: how to add to `prot_areas_3035` a column called `n_ludwigia` with the number of observations for each protected area?
