## Markdown, R Markdown, Quarto: help!

- Markdown: a markup language\* for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor (= you do NOT get what you see).
E.g. make text italic by surrounding it with underscores or asterisks, e.g. `*text*` becomes *text*
- R Markdown: a file type with extension `Rmd` to _knit_ text (in Markdown) and code (in R) together. Goal: generate high quality shareable reports.
- [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html): the R package to write R Markdown documents**.
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/): the follow-up to RMarkdown with the option to include multiple languages.

![:scale 40%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20251028/20251028_hexlogos.png)

<small>\* A markup language is a language that annotates text so that the computer can manipulate that text. Most markup languages are human-readable. More on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language#Descriptive_markup).<br>
\*\* R Markdown is by default installed within RStudio!

# Challenge 0: R Markdown in a nutshell

- `File` ->  `New File` -> `R Markdown...` -> Title: "test", Author: your name, Output format: HTML (deafult)
- Switch to Visual Markdown Editor (VME) and try to write further: amazing, isn't?
- Save it as `test.Rmd`
- **knit** it to create an html page (= `rmarkdown::render("test.Rmd")` if you hate using the mouse as a real geek ⌨️ )

# The YAML header: y a m l what???

The first lines between triple dashes (`---`) is our **header**, needed to configure the output to generate by setting up the title, the author, the output type, etc.

And why is it called a YAML header? Because it is written in YAML :-) YAML is a programming language typically used to write such kind of **configurations**.

Why do people use YAML for writing configurations files? Because YAML is very, very **human readable**.

```

title: "test"
author: "Emma Cartuyvels"
date: "28-10-2025"
output: html_document

# Challenge 1

Convert the text and the code in [20251028_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20251028/20251028_challenges.R) to a Rmd document called `20251028_abv_analysis.Rmd` and _knit_ it as html. Using the cheatsheet and the specific tips provided, please, take care of:

1. Converting the comments to text.

2. Showing the library you need to load but avoiding to show any returned **message** (errors or warnings are allowed). Tip: check the [list](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#text-output) with all test-output chunk options. How to avoid showing **warnings** as well?

3. adding **inline code** where needed, e.g. min(anemone_cube$year) and max(anemone_cube$year) in the script. [Tip](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html).

4. Update the date in the YAML header automatically to the current date everytime you knit. [Tip](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/update-date.html).

5. Paging the data frames so that they look always nice. [Tip](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#data-frame-printing).

# Challenge 2

Let's add some text and code from [20251028_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20251028/20251028_challenges.R) to the Rmd to generate visualizations and maps.

1. Add a table of content. Allow the table of contents being always visible, even when the document is scrolled. [Tip](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#table-of-contents).

2. Add section numbers to the table of content. [Tip](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#section-numbering).

3. Use tabbed sections where mentioned (static plots). Tip: check the [tabbed](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#tabbed-sections) section.

4. The chunk codes for the plots and the dynamic map can be quite long and so potentially distracting for the readers. Please, fold them. Readers can then choose to display them by clicking the fold buttons: Tip: check the [fold-show](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/fold-show.html) section.

## Intermezzo: Quarto (.qmd)

Do you know about [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) documents? Well, probably we all will write them within a year or two...

Quarto is*:

- A way to combine the (benefits of) R (R Markdown, bookdown, tidyverse packages) and Python (Jupyter Book, Jupyter notebooks, pandas, matplotlib) data science ecocystems.
- A rewrite of RMarkdown with multilanguage as a first-class concern.
- A way to get an accessible webpage AND a publication-ready PDF from the same source.
- A really big wrapper around Pandoc (the document converter used to "knit" Rmd documents).
- Not a prototype anymore: tens of thousands of users already.


Do you know that the [Communicate section](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/communicate) of the R for Data Science book focusses on Quarto and is written using Quarto?

One thing is for sure: all effort you did up to now is not for nothing! Quarto is very similar to Rmd.

# Intermezzo: Quarto (.qmd)

The [getting started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) tutorial is the best start to learn Quarto.

Give it a try:

- `File` ->  `New File` -> `Quarto Document...` -> Title: "test", Output format: HTML (deafult)
- Visual Markdown Editor (VME) is used by default, but you can switch to `Source`
- **Render** it to create html (opened automatically in your browser as a Background job)

Check also the talk ["Mixing R, Python, and Quarto: Crafting the Perfect Open Source Cocktail"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8174mk6SGcU&;list=PL9HYL-VRX0oSFkdF4fJeY63eGDvgofcbn&;index=57) by Alenka Frim and Nic Crane.

# Challenge 3

1. Convert the text and the code in [20251028_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20251028/20251028_challenges.R) to a Quarto document called `20251028_abv_analysis.qmd` and _knit_ it as html.

2. Recreate the functionalities from challenge 1 and 2 in this document.

**BONUS** Add figure and table captions to the relevant chuncks.

## Do you know that...

1. Many INBO tutorials are written in R markdown and then _knitted_ as markdown documents? See [example](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/spatial_wfs_services/).
2. Markdown is very popular to easily write (static) webpages. Check the [oscibio](https://oscibio.inbo.be/) team page or the [craywatch](https://craywatch.inbo.be/) website. Both use [Petridish](https://peterdesmet.com/petridish/), a Jekyll* template developed by our colleague Peter Desmet. So, a [Markdown document](https://github.com/inbo/craywatch/blob/main/pages/soorten/faxonius-limosus.md?plain=1) becomes a [webpage](https://craywatch.inbo.be/soorten/faxonius-limosus/).
3. [Data processing pipelines](https://trias-project.github.io/alien-plants-belgium/dwc_mapping.html) published as GitHub pages are actually R markdown documents?
4. The Hackmd pages we use at the INBO coding club follow markdown syntax? Yes, probably you know it!
5. The process of creating an unified checklist of alien species in Belgium (published on GBIF as the [GRIIS checklist of Belgium](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/6d9e952f-948c-4483-9807-575348147c7e)) is a bookdown [document](https://trias-project.github.io/unified-checklist/)? Same for the R reference book of Hadley Wickham, [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). View the [source](https://github.com/hadley/adv-r/blob/master/index.Rmd): amazing, isn't?

<small>* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language (e.g; Markdown) and uses layouts (e.g. Petridsh) to create a static website.
