# Data and scripts description

Today we will work with:

- `20240326_rodents.txt`, a tab separated file with observations of 5 rodents species in Belgium up to 2020.

# Data and scripts description

- Partridge data is inspired by the [yearly partridge counting](https://www.natuurenbos.be/patrijs) that is done from January 15th untill March 31st. Each game management unit (wildbeheerseenheid, **WBE**) is required to count partridges in their territory if they want to hunt them. There are two dataframes:

1. [20240425_partridge.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/main/data/20240425/20240425_partridge.txt): a dataset with observations of partridges. This includes the date of the observation, the fieldworker who submitted the observation, the type of observation (`couple`, `single`, `group`, or only `sound`), and location (WBE number and coordinates `x`, `y`).
2. [20240425_wbe_info.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/main/data/20240425/20240425_wbe_info.txt): for each WBE, this dataframe contains the unique identification number (`wbe`), name, province, and surface area.

- [20240425_ias_plants.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/main/data/20240425/20240425_ias_plants.txt): a list of invasive alien plants. One column contain the scientific names, while the others contain vernacular names in English, Dutch and French.

- [20240425_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20240425/20240425_challenges.R): R script to start from (some code is already provided)

# Why dplyr?

A lot of reasons. But the main one is that it makes data manipulation code easy to read (in comparison with basic R). Other important reasons?

- actively maintained (people from posit, the company behind RStudio).
- works nicely with all other tidyverse packages.
- open development on [GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/): issues, questions, dev ideas etc. are welcome.
- functions have very good names. Some of them are exactly the same as in SQL, e.g. `filter()`, `select()`.

# Challenge 1 - Single table verbs

[Single table verbs](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#single-table-verbs) = functions working on one data.frame.

After reading `partridge` dataset (code provided):

1. Display first 8 rows; display the last 8 rows.

2. Select columns `wbe` and `date`.

3. Display the **distinct** values of `type` as a data.frame with one column, `type`.

4. How to remove observations with type `Sound`? How to remove observations with type = `Sound` and `wbe` = NA?

5. Add a new column called `seen` which is TRUE if `type` is not `"Sound"`. Add a column `month` with the month of the observation. Tip: use `lubridate::month()` function. Install lubridate package if not yet done.

6. **Relocate** the column `seen` after `type` and `month` after `date`.

## Intermezzo - The pipe %>%

From [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#the-pipe) documentation:


![:scale 100%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20240425/20240425_pipe.png)

Can you apply the pipe to concatenate some steps of challenge 1?

# Challenge 2 - Summaries

1. How many observations per WBE? Save it as `overview_partridge` as we will use it in challenge 3.

2. How many observations per WBE and type?

3. Order the previous output per n_obs (descending order), wbe (ascending order) and type (alphabetically).

4. For each month, return the wbe with the highest number of observations and report the number of observations for those wbe that month.

## Intermezzo: dplyr is a living thing

We said at the beginning that dplyr is actively maintained. There is more! dplyr had moved and is actually moving forward to get better and better.

dplyr released in early 2023 an important new version, dplyr 1.1.0. At the moment we are at version 1.1.4. It means new very nice functions have been added, other older functions got superseded or some arguments are deprecated etc. Read more in this 4 blogposts:

- [dplyr 1.1.0: joins](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/01/dplyr-1-1-0-joins/)
- [dplyr 1.1.0: Per-operation grouping](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/02/dplyr-1-1-0-per-operation-grouping/)
- [dplyr 1.1.0: The power of vctrs](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/02/dplyr-1-1-0-vctrs/)
- [dplyr 1.1.0: pick(), reframe(), and arrange()](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/02/dplyr-1-1-0-pick-reframe-arrange/)

## Intermezzo - Two-table verbs

Two-table verbs = functions which take two data.frames as input to typically return one data.frame as output. A nice [article](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html) on dplyr website. The most famous two-table function family is the "join" family. Give a look to the [news around joins](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/01/dplyr-1-1-0-joins/)* also mentioned in previous slide.

# Challenge 3 - Two-table verbs

After reading the game management units details as `WBE` (code provided):

1. Add WBE details in `WBE` to `overview_partridge` (where available)

2. How are the columns ordered? Are the columns of `overview_partridge` on the left? Try to put them on the right.

3. Which WBEs are not in `partridge`, i.e. are not linked to any observation?

4. Some observations have a missing value for column `wbe` and some WBEs have no observations at all. Get rid of them while joining.

5. Now, join both again but retain ALL EXISTING WBEs. Set the number of observations equal to 0 for all WBEs where no partridges were observed.

# dplyr is a living thing

An example:

```
people <- tibble(
  first_name = c("Amber", "Damiano", "Dirk", "Emma", "Raïsa", "Hans"),
  second_name = c("Mertens", "Oldoni", "Maes",
                  "Cartuyvels", "Carmen", "Vancalster")
)

hobbys <- tibble( # purely invented!
  people = c("Hans", "Damiano", "Dirk", "Amber", "Emma", "Raïsa"),
  sport = c("rugby", "football", "hockey", "ski", "tennis", "bowling")
)

# old dplyr, still works! You need "" = "".
people %>%
  left_join(hobbys, by = c("first_name" = "people")
)

# now you can use join_by() and colnames without " "
people %>%
  left_join(hobbys, join_by(first_name == people))
```

# Bonus challenge - Create tidy data with tidyr

Sometimes, the first data manipulation you have to perform is to create tidy data. dplyr might not suffice: you will need another important tidyverse package: [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/).

Tidy data is data where:

- Every column is variable.
- Every row is an observation.
- Every cell is a single value.

# Bonus challenge 1- Create tidy data with tidyr

After reading `20240425_ias_plants.txt` dataset, make it tidy. Please notice that, for some species, two vernacular names are given. See figure below.

# Bonus challenge 2: dplyr + stringr = love

We said that dplyr matches nicely with other tidyverse packages. Example: stringr in this case:

```
a <- tibble(
  name = c("Damiano", "Amber", "Hans", "Dirk", "Emma", "Raïsa"),
  my_favorite_number_string = c("104", "023", "07", "666", "3", "9")
)
## Add the commando here to get this output:

# A tibble: 6 × 2
  name    my_favorite_number_string
  <chr>   <chr>
1 Emma    3
2 Hans    07
3 Raïsa   9
4 Amber   023
5 Damiano 104
6 Dirk    666
```
