# Introduction: When do we ABSOLUTELY need functions?

If both these conditions are true:

- you have to `"do something"` longer than one line of code
- you need to `"do something"` at least for two different inputs

---
class: left, top

# Introduction: When SHOULD we use functions?

- the "do something" is actually a workflow: split it in (small) functions
- the "do something" is very short (e.g. a one-line formula) but often used: putting it in a function will give it an understandable name and will avoid typos

# Introduction: good names

Functions are the building blocks of your data analysis: give your functions understandable and short enough names. It's better for future-you, it's better for everybody.

# Introduction: output of R functions

Can a R function return multiple outputs?

NO. R functions return only **one output**: `return(my_output)`

But you can put your outputs (e.g. a data.frame and a plot) in a list. A named list will make the future-you and any other using the function very happy: documentation begins by naming things :-)

```r
library(tidyverse)
my_summary_function <- function(df, x_colname, y_colname) {
  df_prev <- head(df)
  point_overview <- ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(!!sym(x_colname), !!sym(y_colname)))
  return(list(df_preview = df_prev, plot_overview = point_overview))
}

overview_mtcars_mpg_disp <- my_summary_function(df = mtcars,
                                                x_colname = "mpg",
                                                y_colname = "disp")
overview_mtcars_mpg_disp$df_preview
overview_mtcars_mpg_disp$plot_overview
```

# The data world of doctor Z

Today you play the role of a researcher, dr Z. She received in January 2011 observations of the asian ladybeetle (_Harmonia axyridis_) collected in the surroundings of Antwerp by a contractor. These observations are stored in [20220630_harmonia_axyridis_2010.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20220630/20220630_harmonia_axyridis_2010.txt). She wrote some code to read, analyze and visualize these obsevations. You can find the code in [20220630_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20220630/20220630_challenges.R). She uses a geopacakge shapefile, [20220630_eea_1x1km_grid_BE.gpkg](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20220630/20220630_eea_1x1km_grid_BE.gpkg), containing the official [Belgian 1x1km square grid](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eea-reference-grids-2), as provided by the [European Environment Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/), useful to group observations in a grid.

What it seemed to be a one-shot anlysis, becomes very soon something more: she receives a similar file from another contractor containing observations of the bow-winged grasshopper (_Chorthippus biguttulus_) collected in the same area: [20220630_chorthippus_biguttulus_2010.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20220630/20220630_chorthippus_biguttulus_2010.txt). Important: the columns containing the coordinates are called differently.

# The data world of doctor Z

She also gets to know that she will have to redo the same analysis in the future, for sure on observations of the Asian ladybeetle:
- [20220630_harmonia_axyridis_2011.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20220630/20220630_harmonia_axyridis_2011.txt)
- [20220630_harmonia_axyridis_2012.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20220630/20220630_harmonia_axyridis_2012.txt)

And, she is afraid, new data of bow-winged grasshopper will find her sooner or later.

I think you can find yourself in the role of dr Z in this Oscar awarded movie.

Before starting, a best practice reminder: write the functions in a *separate file*.
You can call it `20220630_functions.R`. You can use your functions in the challenge file by first *sourcing* this file, e.g. `source("./src/20220630/20220630_functions.R")`.

# Challenge 1

1. It's January 2011. After getting the observations of Harmonia axyridis, you
get now observations of Chorthippus biguttulus. Write a function called
`get_obs_2010()` which takes
as argument a species (e.g. `"Harmonia axyridis"`) and returns the observations
of 2010 as a data.frame

2. It's January 2012. dr Z got observations of Harmonia axyridis collected in 2011. She is wise so she is going to change the function she wrote the year before by renaming it `get_obs()` and adding `year` as extra argument. How does she proceed?

# Intermezzo 1: what happens in the function stays in the function!

Uunfortunately not in R :-/

```r
c <- 3
tricky_function <- function(a, b) {
  # `c` is not defined as argument! Sitll, the function works...
  sum <- a + b + c
  return(sum)
}

tricky_function(1, 2)
#> [1] 6
tricky_function(5, 6)
#> [1] 14
tricky_function(10, 20)
#> [1] 33
```

Even if it works what you see above is (very) **bad** practice as it can end up in wrong results.
Better an error than a wrong result, right? So, please be careful!

# Challenge 2 - part 1

1. Write a function called `clean_data()` to handle step 2 and return the cleaned data.frame without suspected or not enough precise observations. Input arguments:
    - `df`: data.frame with observations
    -  `max_coord_uncertain`: maximum of `coordinateUncertaintyInMeters` (numeric), deafult value as in script.
    - `issues_to_discard`: issues whose obs have to be filtered out (character vector), default value as in script.
    - `occurrenceStatus_to_discard`: the `occurrenceStatus` values whose obs have to be filtered out (character vector), default value as in script.
2. Write a function called `assign_eea_cell()` to handle step 3. Return  a `df` as output, with two extra columns: `geometry` and `eea_cell_code`, the last one containing the EEA cell code each observation belongs to. Input argument:
    - `df`: data.frame with observations.
    - `longitude_colname`: character, name of the column with longitude values*.
    - `latitude_colname`: character, name of the column with latitude values*.

<br>
<small> __\* Note__: `!!sym()` can help you to use the longitude/latitude colnames in the `mutate()` step</small>

# Challenge 2 - part 2

3. Although short, step 4 should be put in a function apart, instead of being
part of the previous function. Do you agree? Why?
If you agree, put it in a function called  `get_n_obs_per_cell()`

4. Write a function for step 5. Would you read the shapefile with the EEA grid
of Belgium in the function or outside the function? Up to you to find a good
name to this function :-)

# Intermezzo 2: document your functions with style

C. Bukowski ever wrote that [_"Style is the answer to everything"_](https://www.elyrics.net/read/c/charles-bukowski-lyrics/style-lyrics.html). If not really everything, it's often more than just a nice-to-have feature.

Function documentation is essential while using R. How many times did you use the help (`?function_name`) in your daily woRk?

Documenting your functions can be done with style by following the [Roxygen](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/index.html) conventions as programmers writing functions for R packages do. Again, future-you and your colleagues will praise you. Do you know you can use the [`docstring`](https://github.com/dasonk/docstring) package to create help pages of your functions even if they are not in a package?

Speaking about style, we, at INBO, follow the official and very stylish [INBO Styleguide for R code](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/styleguide_r_code/).

# Intermezzo 2: document your functions with style

```r
install.packages("docstring")
library(docstring)

remove_uneven <- function(numvec) {
  #' Filter uneven values out
  #'
  #' Function to remove uneven values from a numeric vector.
  #'
  #' @param numvec Numeric vector. Length can be variable.
  #'
  #' @return Numeric vector containing only the even numbers in `numvec`.
  #'
  #' @examples
  #' numbers <- 1:10
  #' remove_uneven(numbers)
  #'
  #' # if an empty vector is given, an empty vector is returned
  #' remove_uneven(numeric(0))
  output <- numvec[numvec %%2 == 0]
  return(output)
}
```

# Challenge 3

We are almost there. Adapt the last step (step 6) to be able to
personalize the interactive leaflet. Write a function called
`visualize_obs_cells()`, to allow the user to make leaflet maps for
any `species` and any `year`. Allow the user also to specify his/her own color
palette (`pal`) and the filling color opacity of the cells. You can use the
values in the code as default values. Test the function providing other input values.

---
class: left, top

# Bonus challenge

Now that we have all blocks, what do you think to automatize the entire
workflow by creating a function called `make_report()`? Think about which
arguments you need as input. Return a named list containing:

- the data.frame returned by step 4

- the leaflet map
