## raster, terra, stars, sf, sp, ... HELP!

R is rapidly evolving to fill the gap with Python and C++. Downside: new packages are being developed, old ones are modified or superseded.

### Spatial vector data

Topic of the coding club of October

- **sf** : newest and recommended package
- **sp** : its predecessor

### Spatial raster data

- [**terra**](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/terra-package.html) : newest and recommended package
- [**raster**](https://rspatial.org/raster/pkg/index.html) : its predecessor (no support for sf), match with sp
- [**stars**](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) : for **s**patio**t**emporal **ar**ray**s**

For more info, read this great [article](https://geocompr.github.io/post/2021/spatial-classes-conversion/) about conversions among different spatial classes in R.

## A raster is ...


- a `SpatRaster` object in `terra`
- a  `RasterLayer` object in  `raster`
- a `stars` object in `stars`

# Challenge 1

1. Read `20221124_lu_nara_2016_100m.tif` as a SpatRaster (terra) and call it `lu_nara_2016`. Tip: [basics](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/terra-package.html#i-creating-combining-and-sub-setting-spatraster-objects) from terra documentation
2. Which layers (**names**) does it contain? What is the **crs**? The **ext**ent? The **res**olution? What are the **minmax** values of the raster?
3. **plot** the raster. Note: ignore the errors "`Error in x$.self$finalize() : attempt to apply non-function`"
4. Read `20221124_lu_nara_legend.txt` (code is provided!) so that you can set the
color table associated with `lu_nara_2016`
5. Calculate the most and least occurring land use category in each of the Natura2000 protected areas. Tip: use `exactextractr::exact_extract()` with the right [summary operations](https://isciences.gitlab.io/exactextractr/#summary-operations)

## INTERMEZZO: big files? No problem

Big rasters? No problem! From [`raster` documentation](https://rspatial.github.io/raster/reference/raster-package.html):

  _The package can work with large files because the objects it creates from these files only contain information about the structure of the data, such as the number of rows and columns, the
spatial extent, and the filename, but it does not attempt to read all the cell values in memory. In computations with these objects, data is processed in chunks._

This holds true for `terra` and `stars` as well, of course.

# Challenge 2

1. Read the `20221124_wc2.1_10m_tmin_tmax_01.tif` as `tmin_max`
2. How many layers does it contain? What are their names? What is the CRS? The extent? The resolution?
3. Rename the layers: `wc2.1_10m_tmin_01` to `tmin_01`, `wc2.1_10m_tmax_01` to `tmax_01`.
4. Plot the raster
5. Calculate the difference tmax - tmin and store it as a new raster called `tdiff_tmax_tmin`. How is called the layer? Rename it as `tdiff_01`
6. Save the one layer raster `tdiff_tmax_tmin` as a new GeoTIFF (*.tif) file:  `20221124_tdiff_tmax_tmin_01.tif`
7. Add minimum and maximum temperature as two extra layers to `tdiff_tmax_tmin`
8. Save the three layer raster: overwrite `20221124_tdiff_tmax_tmin_01.tif`
9. After loading country boundaries as polygons (code provided!), calculate the minimum and maximum values of all layers in `tdiff_tmax_tmin` for each country. The output is a data.frame. Tip: use exactextractr::exact_extract() and find the right [summary operations](https://isciences.gitlab.io/exactextractr/#summary-operations)

## INTERMEZZO: bioclimatic variables

WorldClim provides not only basic climate data but also semi-processed biorelated data: see the 19 [bioclimatic variables](https://worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html) such as the Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation Ã—100), Max Temperature of Warmest Month, Mean Temperature of Driest/Wetter Quarter, ...

You can download them from the WorldClim 2.1 [homepage](https://worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html) or directly in R!

```
# install.packages("geodata") # uncomment to install
library(geodata)

bioclim_vars <- worldclim_global(var = "bio", res = 10, path = tempdir())
bioclim_vars
class       : SpatRaster

# Challenge 3

Load the average solar radiation tif file `20221124_wc2.1_5m_srad_01.tif` as  `srad`.

We want to calculate the spatial correlation between average solar radiation and average maximum temperature of January. We can do it by using `terra::focalCor()`.
However, we get the error below. Why? Try to solve this.

```
> focalCor(c(srad, tmin_max$tmax_01), w = 3, function(x, y) cor(x, y))
Error in h(simpleError(msg, call)) :
  error in evaluating the argument 'x' in selecting a method for function 'focalCor':
  [rast] number of rows and/or columns do not match
```

The error disappears, you are happy but the computation takes a lot of time, isn't?
Downsample the rasters by factor 5. Rerun the correlation and plot it. Plot also the histogram of the correlation values.

## Bonus challenge

### Appendices to challenge 1

1. Calculate the areal proportion of land cover classes in each of the Natura2000 protected areas. Note: `exact_extract()` should be combined with a function you have to write. It requires data manipulation knowledge (e.g. dplyr).
2. We do now something similar as in challenge 1 but with continuous rasters. Calculate dataframe with min max and mean altitude for each Belgian province using `exact_extract()`. How to include the province name in the output? (code to get the data is provided in R script!). Tip: check the basic usage of this tutorial https://isciences.gitlab.io/exactextractr/#basic-usage

## BONUS CHALLENGE 2

### Wind - water vapor pressur correlation

Load rasters from files `wc2.1_10m_wind_01.tif` and `wc2.1_10m_vapr_01.tif` and calculate
the correlation between wind speed and water vapor pressure.
