## Cheat sheets or getting started resources

- The "data import cheatsheet" is a cheatsheet for three tidyverse packages: [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/), [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) and [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/). Available as [pdf](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/cheat_sheets/20250130_cheat_sheet_data_import.pdf) or [html](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-import.html).
- The arrow cheatsheet ([pdf](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/main/cheat_sheets/20251216_cheat_sheet_arrow)) is less fancy than the tidyverse one, but contains exactly what you need to work with the [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/) R package.
- The [Getting Started with JSON and jsonlite](https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/articles/jsonlite/json-aaquickstart.html) page is not a cheat sheet, but you don't need more to get started with JSON files in R.

#  Parquet

What are Parquet files?

> "Apache Parquet is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides high performance compression and encoding schemes to handle complex data in bulk and is supported in many programming languages and analytics tools."

Cited from official [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/overview/) documentation.

But why the R package is called Arrow? What's Arrow actually?

> "Apache Arrow defines a language-independent columnar memory format for flat and nested data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs."

Cited from official [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) documentation.

Parquet is optimized for "data at rest" while Arrow is optimized for "data in motion" - and they're designed to work together as part of a unified data pipeline: 
many modern data tools use this combination - storing data in Parquet format on disk for efficient storage and querying, while using Arrow format in memory for fast processing.

# JSON

What's [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)? JSON the acronym for JavaScript Object Notation.
It is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.
It is often used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa). 

One example: GBIF API responses! Example: info about an occurrence via `occurrenceID`: [5908536615](https://api.gbif.org/v1/occurrence/5908536615). Corresponding web page: https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/5908536615.

# Challenge 1 - zenodo, readr and JSON

We know to read tabular data locally saved on our machine using readr. But readr can do more! And that's what we will explore now.
Go to the Zenodo deposit [MH_ANTWERPEN - Western marsh harriers (Circus aeruginosus, Accipitridae) breeding near Antwerp (Belgium)](https://zenodo.org/records/10054153) (zenodo DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3550093)

1. Use readr package to read the file `MH_ANTWERPEN_tracking_data.csv` into R as a data frame called `ref_data`. 
Pay attention to the column specifications. They must be the same as described in the zenodo `datapackage.json
`. Hint: see the section "Column specification with readr" in the data import cheatsheet. Notice also that the datetime format as 
specified in the zenodo metadata, `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"`, is not supported by readr. Check documentation of lubridate::parse_date_time() to see how to handle fractional seconds__ in R.
2. Use readr package to read the GPS zipped file `20251216_MH_ANTWERPEN-gps-2018.csv.gz` into R as a data frame called `gps_data`.
3. Use readr package to read the same file (without prefix `20251216_`) from the zenodo into R as a data frame called `gps_data_url`.
4. Use jsonlite to read the `datapackage.json` file from the zenodo into R as a list called `metadata`. 
If you did everything correct, you should get a list of 3 elements: `id`, `profile` and `resources`. 
Explore it and compare it with the `datapackage.json` file on zenodo.
5. Sometimes you need to download a zenodo deposit programmatically: there is a function in our loved [inborutils](https://inbo.github.io/inborutils/reference/index.html) R package, didnt' you know?
Find it and use it to download the entire zenodo deposit into the folder `data/20251216/mh_antwerpen_data`.*

<small>* Thanks Hans and Floris to write this function!</small>

# Intermezzo - Frictionless Data Packages

The zenodo deposit you work with in challenge 1 is an example of a [Frictionless Data Package](https://datapackage.org/), one of the standards within [Frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/): 
*an open-source toolkit that brings simplicity to the data experience - whether you're wrangling a CSV or engineering complex pipelines.*

__Frictionless Data Package__ is the fundamental building block of Frictionless. 
A Data Package is a simple container format and standard to describe and package a collection of (tabular) data. It is typically used to publish FAIR and open datasets.

Standards based on Frictionless Data Package exist for specific domains:
- Camera traps data exported by Agouti are a specific type of Frictionless Data Package, called Camera Trap Data Package.
- [Darwin Core Data Package](https://gbif.github.io/dwc-dp/#dp) (DwC-DP): an exchange format for biodiversity data. It extends the Frictionless Data Package specification as an implementation for the Darwin Core Conceptual Model. In Public Review phase: it will be the future of GBIF data downloads!

# Intermezzo - Frictionless Data Packages

And do you know that there is an R package to read and write Frictionless Data Packages? The [__frictionless__](https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/) R package!
Its maintainer is our INBO colleague Peter Desmet!

Move to Bonus challenge 1 if you cannot wait using it to import the zenodo package used in challenge 1!

# Challenge 2 - Parquet and arrow


Use the [latest gbif snapshot]("s3://gbif-open-data-eu-central-1/occurrence/2021-11-01/occurrence.parquet"), the [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/) R package and dplyr functions to answer the following questions:

1. How many occurrences are in the dataset?
2. How many unique species are in the dataset?
3. What are the top 10 most observed species in terms of number of occurrences?
4. What is the temporal coverage of the dataset (min and max year of observation)?

Hint: Follow the blog post [Using Apache Arrow and Parquet with GBIF-mediated occurrences](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/apache-arrow-and-parquet/). Opening the snapshot could take a while, be patient!

2. Download the Parquet file (downloadKey: [0054090-251120083545085](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/download/0054090-251120083545085)) using [rgbif](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/). 
It contains all occurrences with spatial coordinates and no geospatial issues taken in Belgium from 2023 and it's 201MB. Be sure to have enough disk space.
Hint: check the section "Downloading a simple parquet from GBIF" from the blog post [Using Apache Arrow and Parquet with GBIF-mediated occurrences](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/apache-arrow-and-parquet/).

# Challenge 3A - Google Spreadsheets

INBO uses Google Workspace as collaborative work environment and data storage. So, it's good to know how to read data from Google Sheets into R.
1. Use the googlesheets4 R package to read the Google Sheet [20251216_list_butterflies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hUd_qWIQ5Lg1g1cfxKyBkD56iUU9lcVeKV6bkN02Ing/edit?usp=sharing) 
into R as two data frames, called `butterflies_2025` and `butterflies_2024`. Tip: you don't need authentication to read public Google Sheets. Check how to disable authentication in the 
[googlesheets4 auth](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/articles/auth.html) vignette.
2. Are these two data frames tidy? If not, can you tidy them up? Apply the tidy data principles*:

- A __dataset__ is a collection of __values__ (numbers, strings, ...).
- Every value belongs to a __variable__ and an __observation__
- A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (e.g. measurement datetime, scientific name, transect identifier) across units.
- An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (e.g. an observation of species A at day 1 in transect a1) across attributes.

Variable = column; Observation = row; Observational unit = table (data frame).

# Challenge 3B - readxl and tidy data

Use [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) R package to load the data from the Excel file `20251216_butterfly_transect_count_raw.xlsx` and save at least a data frame called `transect_counts` with three columns:
- species: species name
- section: transect section identifier
- n: number of individuals observed

The Excel file is a great example of dataset which is very readable by humans, but in a "messy format" for computers. Can you tidy it up? Apply the tidy data principles *:

> Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.

Aside the transect counts, Which are the other observational units contained in the file?
How to link all tables? You will need to create unique identifiers. Which columns can be used for this?
This exercise can take a while and can require some other tidyverse packages e.g. tidyr, dplyr, stringr, purrr.

<small> \* More info about tidy data in ["Tidy Data"](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). Wickham, H. (2014). Tidy Data. Journal of Statistical Software, 59(10), 1-23.
