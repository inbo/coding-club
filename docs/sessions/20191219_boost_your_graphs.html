## Recap: what did I learn during the last coding club?

1. The ggplot recipe: <strong>data - mapping - geometry</strong>
2. Mapping can be defined in the geometry (and often that's the case)
3. The most important mapping argument? **aes**thetics!
4. Put all arguments which require variables (= columns) in `aes()`, all other arguments outside.

# Challenge 1

## One plot, multiple geometries? Yes, we can

Use dataframe `fit_results` to:

1. Plot number of observations (`obs`) versus time (`year`) and *facet* by species (`scientificName`). Arrange them in two rows and two columns.  As  y- and x- ranges are quit different among species, check that each plot has own y- and x-scale.
3. Add fit values (`fit` column) as red dotted line.
4. Add confidence interval area (lower value: `lcl`, upper value: `ucl`) with transparency equal to 0.3 and use purple as filling color.
5. Set "Number of observations in Belgian Natura2000 protected areas" as title and "Source: GBIF" as subtitle.
7. Left align both title and subtitles (`INBOtheme` centers authomatically title and subtitles).

Your plot is now ready for being inserted in the paper.

class: left, middle

# Challenge 2

You submitted the paper. The reviewer likes the plot a lot. Still, he/she asked the following minor review:
<br>
<i>add a general plot above the subplots of previous challenge. I suggest to use area plots</i>.
<br> Hint: you need a ggplot extension like `cowplot` or `egg`.

## Intermezzo: "Back to black"

Do you like black backgrounds? Then you should try the themes from `ggdark` package! <br>

Run:
- `install.packages("ggdark")`
- `library(ggdark)`

and have fun!

# Challenge 3

### Option 1

The reviewer from challenge 2 approved the paper! He likes it, but still... He is the typical graphic freak. He wrote: <i>Why not adding the official logo of gbif on the left next to the title instead of subtitle "Source: GBIF"?</i><br>
Do not download the logo. Just use the link as provided in the R source code.
<br>
Hint: the [magick](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/08/15/magick-10/) package does magic.

background-image: url({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/background_challenge_3.png)

# Challenge 3

### Option 2

You don't have time to satisfy the reviewer: you need to <i>animate</i> a plot of an earlier submitted paper (see code in option 2 of challenge 3 in source R file). Another graphic freak reviewer (maybe the same one?) suggests this minor review: <br>
<i>instead of so many subplots, I would use an animation plot over time (year-month-day) to show the hidefoot length vs weight for all surveys taken **up to that year**.</i>
<br>
Hint: check out the brilliant [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html) package, in particular its *tansitions* functions in combination with *shadows* functions (see list of functions in [reference](https://gganimate.com/reference/index.html)).
<br>
Or: the [magick](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/08/15/magick-10/) package does magic again, but preparing the data it's a bit longer...
