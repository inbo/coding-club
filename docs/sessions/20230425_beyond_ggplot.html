# RECAP: ggplot recipe: data - mapping - geometry

![:scale 80%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20230425/20230425_ggplot_recipe.png)

---
class: left, top

## Recap: mapping

Mapping can be defined in either `ggplot()` or the geometry `geom_*()`.

```r
# mapping in ggplot()
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point()
# mapping in geometry geom_point()
ggplot(ToothGrowth) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len))
```

What to do with multiple plots (geometries)?

```r
# set all args of aes() in each geom_*()
ggplot(ToothGrowth) +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len, group = dose)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len))
# put common args of aes() in ggplot()
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(group = dose)) +
  geom_point()
```

---
class: left, top

## Recap: mapping - aesthetics

The most important mapping argument? **aes()**thetics! Put all arguments which require variables (= columns) in `aes()`, leave all other arguments out.

```r
# you want color represents the supplement (supp)
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = supp))

# you want all points are blue hollow triangles
ggplot(ToothGrowth, mapping = aes(x = dose, y = len)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", shape = 2)
```

# Challenge 1. Combine separate ggplots

Let's play with [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/), one of the highest rated registered extension of ggplot.

1. Display `ias_first_obs_be` and `ias_first_obs_reg` next to each other

2. Display `ias_first_obs_reg` below `ias_first_obs_be`

3. Similar to 2, but this time instead of showing dodge histograms altogether,
display different regions as different facets and call it
 `ias_first_obs_reg_facets`. You should end up with one big histogram on top
 and 3 histograms (= 3 locations) at the bottom of the plot. Tip: adding a facet
 to `ias_first_obs_reg` is standard ggplot.

4. Starting from the histogram ias_first_obs_be, display different kingdoms as
 facets. Then, put this plot on the right, the plots in 3 on the left.

5. Display `ias_first_obs_reg_facets` on the left and a table with three rows
 showing the total number of introductions at regional level on the right.

# Intermezzo. How to choose a color palette: the viridis palette

Today we won't speak about colors. Still, take in mind this criteria when choosing a color palette:

1. printer-friendly (gray scale)
2. perceptually uniform
3. easy to read by those with colorblindness.

All of this can be found in the [viridis palette](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/07/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/) which avoids the red and to go from blue to yellow passing through green (_viridis_: green in Latin).

More about colors in Bonus Challenge and Resources slides.

# Challenge 3A. Animate your plot

Create a GIF as the one below by using ggplot2 and
[gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) packages. Use `"cubic-in-out"`
_easing_ to smooth the transition between states. Save the GIF on disk as well
(width = 1000, height = 300). Kind of a bonus: save it as a video instead.

# Challenge 3B. Create interactive plots

The R package [plotly](https://plotly-r.com/) is an R package for creating interactive web-based graphs via plotly's JavaScript graphing library. In particular, you can make your ggplot plots interactive!

1. Make the plot `ias_first_obs_paths` interactive. Explore the interactivity
 tools. In particular check the legend filtering capabilities on pathway!
 Tip: documentation in the ["intro to ggplotly"](https://plotly-r.com/overview.html#intro-ggplotly)
 section.

2. How to add _dynamic ticks_ functionality to the interactive plot in 1?
 Dynamic ticks means generating new axis ticks while zooming in/out

3. Improve the text shown while hovering so that it looks something like in screenshot below

# Bonus challenge: have fun with color palettes

There are so many color palettes available. Get inspired! Examples:
- [wesanderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson): it allows you to use (some of) the palettes derived from the amazing Tumblr blog ["Wes Anderson Palettes"](http://wesandersonpalettes.tumblr.com/)
- [ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/index.html): it offers a collection of high-quality ggplot compatible color palettes.

Try to apply the viridis palette mentioned in the Intermezzo and other palettes from the packages mentioned above to some of the plots we created today.

# The package of the month. Hans' choice 2

Hans Vancalster inspires us again! The [ggpcp](https://yaweige.github.io/ggpcp/index.html) package to create *generalized parallel coordinate plots* in the ggplot2 framework. Interesting also to read [this](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2023.2195462) article about it. Example:
