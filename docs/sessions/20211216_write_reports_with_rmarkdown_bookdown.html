## Introduction: open software

During the coding club about spatial vector data in October, we found that the description of the arguments of `sf::st_contains()` are inverted in the cheat sheet. Issue already open since 2019. Sometimes daring to ask for updates helps :-)

## Markdown, R Markdown, bookdown, INBOmd: help!

Some definitions:

- **Markdown**: a markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. E.g. make text italic by surrounding it with underscores or asterisks, e.g., __text__ or **text**
- R Markdown: a file type with extension `Rmd` to _knit_ text (in Markdown) and code (in R) together. goal: save and execute code and generate high quality shareable reports.
- [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html): the R package to write R Markdown documents. **note**: by default installed within RStudio!
- [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/): R package to make authoring _books_ or technical documents out of a series of R Markdown documents
- [INBOmd](https://github.com/inbo/INBOmd): R package containing templates to generate reports, slides or posters with the corporate identity of INBO or the Flemish government.

## Coding club play tables

**Like** a card club, we will split us in different tables (aka _breakout rooms_) and we will help each other! We return all together after a fixed amount of time to discuss each challenge apart.

**Unlike** a card club, in our club there is no winner, neither within a table nor among tables!

<br> No yellow sticky notes online. We use hackmd (see next slide) but basic principle doesn't change.

### Share your code during the coding session!

# Challenge 0

Using Rstudio interface to create a new R Markdown document:

- `File` ->  `New File` -> `R Markdown...` -> Title: "test", Author: your name, Output format: HTML (deafult)
![:scale 50%]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/20211216/20211216_challenge0_new_rmd.png)
- Save it as `test.Rmd`
- **knit** it (shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+k) to render it (= `render()` in console)

# The YAML header: iammol what???

The firs lines between triple dashes (`---`) is our **header**, needed to configurate the output to generate by setting up the title, the author, the output type, etc. And what does YAML satnds for? YAML is a programming language typically used to write such kind of **configurations**. Why YAML? Because it is very, very **human readable**.

```r
---
title: "test"
author: "Damiano Oldoni"
date: "14-12-2021"
output: html_document

```

# Download data and code

- Download everything automatically via `inborutils::setup_codingclub_session()`
- manually*, from [data/20211216](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20211216/) and [src/20211216](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20211216). Place the R script in your folder `src/20211216/` and data in `data/20211216/`.


1. [20211216_challenges.R](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20211216/20211216_challenges.R): R script about geese counts.
2. [20211216_geese_counts.txt](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20211216/20211216_geese_counts.txt): geese cath data to use within `20211216_challenges.R`.

# Challenge 1

Convert the code below to a Rmd document called `1_geese_read_data.Rmd` and make an html version of it. Please, take care of:

1. Converting the comments to text
2. Show the library you need to load but avoid to return any **message** (but errors or warnings are allowed). Tip: one test output chunk option from [this list](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#text-output). How to avoid showing **warnings** as well?
3. Set date authomatically in YAML header by setting: `Date:  "``Sys.Date()``"`
4. Do you want always good looking tables with the smallest effort possible? Set `df_print` argument in header (see example below)
5. Add a table of content (see example below)

## Did you know that...

1. Many INBO tutorials are written in R markdown and then _knitted_ as markdown documents? See [example](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_gbif_name_matching/).
2. [Data processing pipelines](https://trias-project.github.io/alien-plants-belgium/dwc_mapping.html) published as GitHub pages are R markdown documents?
3. Hackmd pages follow markdown syntax?

## Go pro

From a R markdown document to a full INBO report? Get inspired by nice [Thierry's workshop](https://inbomd-examples.netlify.com/inbomd_workshop/inbomd_workshop.pdf).

# Ideas for 2022

## Timeline and topics

As for 2021, the coding club would like to reflect the research process: read, process, visualize, report. What do you think about? Which topics do you miss? Would you like to give a special edition on a specific topic?
