## Recap: what did I learn during the last coding club?

The ggplot recipe: <strong>data - mapping - geometry</strong>

## Recap: what did I learn during the last coding club?

1. Mapping can be defined in the geometry
2. The most important mapping argument? **aes**thetics!
3. Put all arguments which require variables (= columns) in `aes()`, all other arguments outside in the geomtry

Example:

```r
# Color depends on Treatment, shape on Type
ggplot(CO2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = conc,
                 y = uptake,
                 color = Treatment,
                 shape = Type))

# All points are black and hollow
ggplot(CO2) +
    geom_point(aes(x = conc, y = uptake),
               color = "black", shape = 1)
```

### Share your code during the coding session!

<!-- Create a new hackmd file and replace this link (twice!) -->
Go to https://hackmd.io/SEuVG7pURQmvUGVjeXOrLA?edit

## Load the required packages

```

library(viridis)
library(plotly)
library(gganimate)
```

# Download data and code

Instead of downloading the files manually we have a new `inborutils` function called `setup_codingclub_session()`. If you have not used this function yet, restart your R session and update the `inborutils` package by running:

```r
if (!"remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("inbo/inborutils")
```

To download the coding club material of today, just run `setup_codingclub_session()`. In general, you can use the date in "YYYYMMDD" format , e.g. `setup_codingclub_session("20201027")`, to download the coding club material of October, 27. For all options, check the [tutorial online](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_setup_codingclub_session/).

Of course, you can still download [data](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20201217/) and [scripts](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20201217/) manually*!

# User cases

Today we will basically work on two usercases (`usercase1`, `usercase2`). Run introductory section in R script to create them. You should end up with two plots as shown below (left: `usercase1`, right: `usercase2`).

# Challenge 1. Color palettes

1. A palette is nothing more than a character vector of colors. Create your own 4-color palette with [color picker](http://tristen.ca/hcl-picker/). Example: https://tristen.ca/hcl-picker/#/clh/4/1/3F2119/EEBEA2.

2. How to apply it to user case 1?

3. How to apply it to user case 2?

## Intermezzo. The prerequisites of a color palette

A color palette should be:
1. printer-friendly (gray scale)
2. perceptually
uniform
3. easy to read by those with colorblindness.

All of this can be found in the [viridis palette](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/07/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/) which avoids the red and goes from blue to yellow passing through green (viridis: _green_ in Latin).

And do you know you can simulate several cases of colorblindness (protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia) by using `dichromat` package? More on this [viridis blogpost](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/07/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/).

Another great tool for simulating color blindness is the [`colorblindr` R package](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/how-to-stimulate-colorblindness-vision-in-r-figures/).

# Challenge 2

`ggplot2` includes some functions to use viridis palette directly.

1. How to apply viridis **discrete** color scale to user case 1?
2. How to apply viridis **continuous** color scale to user case 2?
3. Invert the color direction. Note: typically inverted color directions are less intuitive
4. Use colormap `"cividis"` instead of default (`"viridis"`)

# Challenge 3A. Interactive plots

1. Make interactive plots of user case 1 and 2 using `plotly` package. Tip: follow this nice [plotly tutorial](https://www.musgraveanalytics.com/blog/2018/8/24/how-to-make-ggplot2-charts-interactive-with-plotly)
2. How to personalize the text displayed while hovering on the tiles of user case 2? Tip: same tutorial mentioned above or google it

# Challenge 3B. Animated plots

By making an animation plot you can see the evolution of the average covered area over time from 2000 to 2018. See example below created by using the [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html) package. Some guidelines:

1. Make a basic animation plot and set year in the title
2. Improve [entering and exiting](https://gganimate.com/articles/gganimate.html#enter-and-exit) among states
3. Save the animation as gif and set width - height to 800-550 pixels
4. If you hate gifs you can save the animation as a mp4 video ([ffmpeg executable](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows) needed)

# Bonus challenge

ggplot functions `scale_color_brewer()` and `scale_fill_brewer()` allows you to use the brewer color palettes, which are also very nice and satisfy the criteria mentioned above.

1. Which _type_ should you use for better distinguishing different biotopes of user case 1? How to specify a specific palette instead of the default one? Tip: give a look to the blogpost [*The a-z of RcolorBrewer palette*](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/the-a-z-of-rcolorbrewer-palette/#display-all-brewer-palettes)

2. You could think that `scale_fill_brewer()` would allow you to do the same for user case 2. But you get this error below. How to solve it? Tip: load `RColorBrewer` pacakge and give a look to the blogpost mentioned above
