## Recap: what did I learn during the last coding club?

1. The ggplot recipe: <strong>data - mapping - geometry</strong>
2. Mapping can be defined in the geometry
3. The most important mapping argument? **aes**thetics!
4. Put all arguments which require variables (= columns) in `aes()`, all other arguments outside in the geomtry

<br> No yellow sticky notes online :-( We use hackmd (see next slide) but basic principle doesn't change.

### Share your code during the coding session!

<!-- Create a new hackmd file and replace this link (twice!) -->
Go to https://hackmd.io/@damianooldoni/Sya032s9P/edit

## Load the required packages

```

library(viridis)
```

# Download data and code

Instead of downloading the files manually we have a new `inborutils` function called `setup_codingclub_session()`. If you have not used this function yet, restart your R session and update the `inborutils` package by running:

```r
if (!"remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("inbo/inborutils")
```

To download the coding club material of today, just run `setup_codingclub_session()`. In general, you can use the date in "YYYYMMDD" format , e.g. `setup_codingclub_session("20201027")`, to download the coding club material of October, 27. For all options, check the [tutorial online](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_setup_codingclub_session/).

Of course, you can still download [data](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20201217/) and [scripts](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/src/20201217/) manually*!

<small>* __Note__: check the getting started instructions on [how to download a single file](https://inbo.github.io/coding-club/gettingstarted.html#each-session-setup)</small>

# Uesr cases

Today we will work on two usercases (`usercase1`, `usercase2`). Run introductory section in R script to make them.

# Challenge 1. colors

1. A palette is nothing more than a character vector of colors. Create your own 4-color palette with [color picker](http://tristen.ca/hcl-picker/). Example: https://tristen.ca/hcl-picker/#/clh/4/1/3F2119/EEBEA2.

2. How to apply it to user case 1?

3. How to apply it to user case 2?

## Intermezzo

A color palette should be:
1. printer-friendly (gray scale)
2. perceptually
uniform
3. easy to read by those with colorblindness.

All of this can be found in the [viridis palette](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/07/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/) which avoids the red and to go from blue to yellow passing through green (viridis: green in Latin).

And do you know you can simulate several cases of colorblindness by using `dichromat`? More on this [viridis blogpost](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/07/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/).

```
library(purrr)
with_palette(
  compose(
    partial(dichromat, type = "deutan"),
    jet.colors
    )
)
```

# Challenge 2

`ggplot2` includes some functions to use viridis palette directly.

1. How to apply viridis discrete color scale to user case 1?
2. How to apply viridis continuous color scale to user case 2?
3. Invert the color direction. Note: typically inverted color directions are less intuitive
4. Use colormap "cividis" instead of default ("viridis")

# Bonus challenge

ggplot functions `scale_color_brewer()` and `scale_fill_brewer()` allows you to use the brewer color palettes, which are also very nice and satisfy the criteria mentioned above.
1. Which _type_ should you use for better distinguishing different biotopes of user case 1? How to specify a specific palette instead of the default one? Tip: the a-z of rcolorbrewer palette](https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/the-a-z-of-rcolorbrewer-palette/#display-all-brewer-palettes)
2. You could think that `scale_fill_brewer()` would allow you to do the same for user case 2. But you get this error below. How to solve it?
