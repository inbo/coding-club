## Coding club tables

**Like** a card club, we will split us in different tables (aka _breakout rooms_) and we will help each other! We return all together after a fixed amount of time to discuss each challenge apart.

**Unlike** a card club, in our club there is no winner, neither within a table nor among tables!

### Share your code during the coding session!

<!-- Create a new hackmd file and replace this link (twice!) -->
Go to https://hackmd.io/qjtMSYw4Tm2-V60C_hPx5Q?both and start by adding your name in section "Participants".

# Download data and code

Today no R code script and only one data.frame to download

You can download the material:

- automatically via `inborutils::setup_codingclub_session()`*

- manually** from GitHub folder [coding-club/data/20210525](https://github.com/inbo/coding-club/blob/master/data/20210525/)

<br>
<small> __\* Note__: you can use the date in "YYYYMMDD" format to download the coding club material of a specific day, e.g. run `setup_codingclub_session("20201027")` to download the coding club material of October, 27 2020. If date is omitted, the date of today is used. For all options, check the [tutorial online](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/r_setup_codingclub_session/).</small>

# Data description

Today we work on both dummy data and more serious biological data.

## Dummy data

Two datasets: `coding_club_core_team` and  `bmk_team`

## Biological data

GBIF butterfly checklist data, inspired by Dirk's [Eurobutt checklist](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/f9af6ffd-febc-4626-b2e8-809b1c60fa01#description). The downloaded data includes information of butterflies found in West-Europe.

You have just downloadeded:
- `taxon`: a taxon core data.frame with taxonomic information. Each butterfly has a unique identifier (column `id`)
- `distribution`: in which countries the taxa are found and their threat status in each country. Link to`taxon` in column `taxon_id`
- `vernacularname`: vernacular names in English. Link to `taxon` in column `taxon_id`

# Challenge 1

1. How to add orcid information to coding club core team dataframe (where available)?

2. How are the columns ordered? Are the columns of coding_club_core_team on the left?
Try to get same result but putting them on the right

3. Join coding club core team with BMK team and retain only people who are part of both.

4. How to invert the order of the columns?

5. Now, join both again but retain ALL, some NAs will appear, of couse
