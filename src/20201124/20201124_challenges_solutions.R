# INTERMEZZO. Aesthetics

#' This works:

ggplot(CO2, aes(x = Type, y = uptake)) + geom_violin()

#' This works too

ggplot(CO2) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = Type, y = uptake))

#' What should I use? Both are good, but, but, but...
#' But what if you want to plot two or more geometries with different aesthetics? Which syntax is more readable?

# Example 1

# Option 1 (make changes to aesthetics of second geomtry, less readable)
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = Type, y = uptake, color = Treatment)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_violin(aes(color = NULL), alpha = 0.5)

# Option 2 (specify both aesthetics separately, maybe reduandant)
ggplot(CO2) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = Type, y = uptake, color = Treatment)) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = Type, y = uptake), alpha = 0.5)

# Option 3 (specify the common part of the two aesthetics, best compromise)
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = Type, y = uptake)) +
  geom_violin(aes(color = Treatment)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5)

# Example 2

# Option 1
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, colour = Type, group = Plant)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(group = NULL)

# Option 2
ggplot(CO2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = conc, y = uptake, group = Plant, colour = Type)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = conc, y = uptake, colour = Type))

# Option 3
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, colour = Type)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = Plant)) +
  geom_smooth()


# Challenge 2

#' Whatâ€™s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not green and
#' transparency not correct?
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = "green", alpha = 0.1)) +
  geom_point()

#' how to solve it?
#' in aes() only variables like column names!
#' Fixed values in correspondent geometry
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake)) +
  geom_point(color = "green", alpha = 0.1)


#' With so many points it is hard to see the effect of `treatment` or `type` on `uptake`, isn't it? A box plot ( `geom_boxplot()`) could help, but what's gone wrong here? The x , `conc`, doesn't make any sense
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = Treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot()

#' How to solve it?

#' SOLUTION 1
#' Make a factor of concentration (conc) via as.factor()
#' Notice that conc is now returned as factor so valeus are equally spaced
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = as.factor(conc), y = uptake, color = Treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot()

#' SOLUTION 2
#' group data by the combination of conc (as factor) and Treatment
#' Notice that conc valus on x are NOT equally spaced
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc,
                y = uptake,
                group = as.factor(conc):Treatment,
                color = Treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot()


#' How do you see the concentration `conc`?
#' As a categorical variable (= factor)? Or a quantitative variable? That's the key

# as quantitative variable
ggplot(CO2) +
  geom_col(aes(x = conc, y = uptake))

# as categorical variable
ggplot(CO2) +
  geom_col(aes(x = as.factor(conc), y = uptake))

# Challenge 3

#' Sometimes using colors, shapes, etc. is not
#' sufficient: you would like to split data in a grid of subplots to ease interpretation.
#'
#' How to modify this code to show data of each plant apart forming a grid of 12 subplots?
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = Treatment, shape = Type)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = Treatment, shape = Type)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Plant) +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12))


#' The dataframe `area_biotopes` contains the average area (`meanArea`) and standard error (`seArea`) of 4 biotopes per year in the grid cells where two flinders species (Pararge aegeria and Limenitis camilla) were observed. This was done in Flanders (`FL`), South-Netherland (`NL_South`) en North-Netherland (`NL_North`).

area_biotopes <- read_csv("./data/20201124/20201124_area_biotopes.txt", na = "")

#' The plot on the left is unreadable
ggplot(area_biotopes,
            aes(x = year,
                y = meanArea,
                colour = species,

                alpha = region)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = meanArea - seArea,
                      ymax = meanArea + seArea))

#' The plot on the right is much better, isn't? Try to get something similar or even better!

# BONUS CHALLENGE

#' In challenge 1 we tried to understand the effect of `Type`  (`Quebec`, `Mississipi`) and `Treatment` (`chilled` , `nonchilled`) separately via box plots. Now we would like, still by means of a box plot, to see the effect of the interaction of these two variables together, so that we have four different situations (2 Type x 2 Treatment).

#' Using interaction() allows specifying the separator where needed
ggplot(CO2) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = conc,
                   y = uptake,
                   group = as.factor(conc):Type:Treatment,
                   color = interaction(Type, Treatment, sep = "-"))) +
  labs(x = "concentration", color = "Type-Treatment")

# You can use always interaction() of course
ggplot(CO2) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = conc,
                   y = uptake,
                   group = interaction(as.factor(conc), Type, Treatment),
                   color = interaction(Type, Treatment, sep = "-"))) +
